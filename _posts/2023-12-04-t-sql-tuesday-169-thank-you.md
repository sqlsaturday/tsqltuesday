[Invitation](https://www.kayondata.com/posts/2023/t-sql-invite-december2023/) from [Kay Sauter](https://www.kayondata.com/)

T-SQL Tuesday No. 169 – December 2023 I’ve got the honor to invite you to the blog party [SQLTuesday](https://tsqltuesday.com/), tagged as #tsql2sday, for this December 2023. Many thanks to Steve Jones ([blog](https://voiceofthedba.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/way0utwest)) for letting me host this month’s blog party!

December is the last month of a year. I believe December is the season of being thankful, or at least looking back. I also believe that we generally do not say “thank you” enough to people. So I invite and encourage you to say thank you to anyone who helped you:

- Work colleagues or employers
- Mentors
- Friends
- Family

Your post does not have to be personal, it can also be just a story you anonymize people so that the reader who it actually matters, will know that you appreciate them. If you even can incorporate some code, please do! Happy blogging and happy SQLTuesday! Please publish your blog article on December 12 2023.
