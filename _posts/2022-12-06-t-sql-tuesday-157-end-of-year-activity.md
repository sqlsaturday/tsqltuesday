This month’s [invitation](https://garrybargsley.com/2022/12/06/t-sql-tuesday-157-end-of-year-activity/) and [recap](https://garrybargsley.com/2022/12/20/t-sql-tuesday-157-end-of-year-activity-recap/) from Garry Bargsley.

Welcome to the final T-SQL Tuesday for 2022. My ask is, what do you have planned for end-of-year activities for your SQL environment? Do you have annual processes or procedures you run? Do you clean up documentation? Do you just take time off and hope someone else does the work?

###### **Some Examples:**

- Purge log data
- Archive databases for long term
- Look for orphaned data/log files on your SQL Servers
- Do Security analysis for no longer needed accounts
- Add new years dates to dimension tables
