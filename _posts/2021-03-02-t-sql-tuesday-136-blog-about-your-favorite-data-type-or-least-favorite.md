[Invitation](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/tsql2sday-136-invitation-blog-about-your-favorite-data-type-or-least-favorite/) and [wrap-up](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/03/tsql2sday-136-wrap-up-your-favorite-and-least-favorite-data-types/) from [Brent Ozar](https://www.brentozar.com/blog/).

**Your mission: write a blog post about your favorite [data type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql), and schedule it for next Tuesday, March 9.**

Mad about [money](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/money-and-smallmoney-transact-sql)? Feverish about [float](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/float-and-real-transact-sql)? Tell us what you use your favorite data type for, and what people need to know before they get started using it. Data types have so many interesting edge cases, like when [Aaron Bertrand taught us to use lower case for our data types](https://www.sentryone.com/blog/aaronbertrand/backtobasics-lower-case-data-types). (I still donâ€™t do that, but for the record, I do feel guilty.)
