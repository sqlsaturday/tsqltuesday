[Invitation ](https://andyleonard.blog/2024/06/t-sql-tuesday-175-old-tech-new-tech-bold-tech-blue-tech/)from [Andy Leonard](https://andyleonard.blog/).

[Microsoft Build 2024](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/home) was just last month (at the time of this writing) and the sheer number of announcements is almost overwhelming! You can read about the announcements from the [Build Book of News](https://news.microsoft.com/build-2024-book-of-news/) and [view selected sessions online](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/home).

I am honored to host this month’s [T-SQL Tuesday](http://tsqltuesday.com/) and the topic I chose is: How do you balance the benefits and liabilities of older, existing data and software platforms compared with newer platforms? What factors do you consider? Which features motivate you to switch or stay? I’m almost positive the answer is, “It depends,” and I certainly understand because that’s also my answer! I ask that you complete that sentence, though; what does “it depend” *upon*?

# “It Depends on…”

I spend most of my time with data platforms. I focus on data engineering so I pay particular attention to the field. My answer is: I weigh the pros and cons and (attempt to) measure the inertia of switching against sticking with the existing platforms. There’s objectivity *and* subjectivity in this approach. Where’s the line between the two? Excellent question.

## Regarding Data Engineering

Although I continue to provide ADF and SSIS training and consulting, I am all-in on [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) – specifically Fabric Data Factory.

I looked at Fabric Data Factory after Fabric entered public preview during Microsoft Build 2023. I poked around a bit and decided, “Not yet.”

I looked again in November 2023 and concluded: “Huh. Ok. Time to tinker.” Since I was busy with client work, I really didn’t have time to tinker until January 2024, and what I saw impressed me mightily. I cannot recall the specific features and improvements I saw, but they weren’t there in November and they *were* there in January. I was hooked. Since that time I’ve been paying attention to the posts of Fabric people at Microsoft as well as the [Microsoft Fabric Updates Blog](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-US/blog/) (yes, there’s a blog focused solely on Fabric updates… that’s a clue).

I noticed Microsoft is investing a lot of time and energy (i.e. money) into Fabric. In fact, I’ve never witnessed Microsoft develop so much so fast in my experience, and my experience dates back to when the years began with a 1. Having years of experience isn’t good for many things, but it’s great for identifying trends that span decades.

That’s why I’m all-in.

## How About You?
