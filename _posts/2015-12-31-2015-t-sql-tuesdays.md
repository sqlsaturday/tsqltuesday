- October – T-SQL Tuesday #71 – [SQL Server Audit](http://sqlity.net/en/2890/tsql2sday-71-sql-server-audit/) () – For this month, I would like to invite you to write about Auditing.

- August – T-SQL Tuesday #69 – [Encryption](http://sqlbama.com/archive/2015/08/t-sql-tuesday-69-encryption/) ([roundup](http://sqlbama.com/archive/2015/08/t-sql-tuesday-69-round-up/)) – Write about how you use encryption, why not, what’s blocking you, or what you just learned.

We all change things after we install an instance, sometimes not until we encounter a problem. Write about something you’ve dealt with as far as defaults go.
- June – T-SQL Tuesday #67 – [Extended Events](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/uncategorized/youre-invited-to-t-sql-tuesday-67-extended-events/) ([Wrap-up](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/uncategorized/t-sql-tuesday-67-extended-events-target-blog/)) – How have you used extended events? If you haven’t, try to learn something, set up a session, and write about it.

By “focused,” he means tackle something head on; the more secret sauce, tricks, code samples, operator costs, or demonstrable metrics against a defined problem the better.
- Feb -T-SQL Tuesday #63 – [How Do You Manage Security?](http://sqlstudies.com/2015/02/03/tsql-tuesday-63-how-do-you-manage-security/) ([roundup](http://sqlstudies.com/2015/02/12/tsql-tuesday-63-how-do-you-manage-security-rollup/)) – What tips, tricks, techniques, or philosophies do you have around security?
