[Invitation](http://devnambi.com/2014/tsql-tuesday/) and [wrap](http://devnambi.com/2014/tsql-tuesday-summary/) from [Dev Nambi](http://devnambi.com).

<div id="wrap"><div class="container">It’s hard to rock the boat.  
It’s hard to ask the basic questions that everybody knows.  
It’s hard to slow down and ask for clarification.

So, we improvise. We guess: things that are accepted as true, without proof. We often forget our assumptions, or make them instinctively.

For this T-SQL Tuesday, the topic is **assumptions**.

For example:

- The sun will come up tomorrow.
- Firewalls and anti-virus are enough to protect my computer.
- My backups work even if I don’t restore them.
- I don’t need to check for *that* error, it’ll never happen.

Your assignment for this month is to write about a big assumption you encounter at work, one that people are uncomfortable talking about. Every team has an [elephant in the room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room).

**What happens if these big guesses aren’t true?**
