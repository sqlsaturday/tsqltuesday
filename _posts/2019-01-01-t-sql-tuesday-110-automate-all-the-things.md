[Invitation ](https://garrybargsley.com/t-sql-tuesday-110-automate-all-the-things/)and [recap](https://garrybargsley.com/t-sql-tuesday-110-automate-all-the-things-recap/) from Garry Bargsley.

Have you heard the phrase “Automate All the Things”? That seemed to be the top buzz phrase of 2018 and means different things to different people.

Kicking off the T-SQL Tuesday season for 2019, I would like to ask, what does “Automate All the Things” mean to you? Everyone’s environment is different, everyone’s day-to-day looks different, everyone is a fan of different technologies and everyone’s environment is of different size. While I might want to automate checking of my backup success across my 500 servers, you might want to automate how new servers are provisioned. This can be a very broad topic, that could include a broad range of technologies. You might choose one type of technology to accomplish a task, where I might choose another.

**So technically there are two tasks for this month:**

- What do you want to automate or what automation are you proud of completing?
- What is your go-to technology for automation?

**Possible suggestions/ideas:**

- PowerShell
- Chef
- Ansible
- Terraform
- DevOps
- tSQLt
- Containers
- Cloud
- VSTS
- Python
- Bash
- Code Deployments
- VS Code
- dbatools
- T-SQL (honorable mention)
