[Invitation](https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2018/08/t-sql-tuesday-105-invitation-brick-wall/) and [WrapUp](https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2018/08/tsql-tuesday-105-wrapup/) from [Wayne Sheffield](http://blog.waynesheffield.com).

### Brick Wall

Tell me about a time when you ran up against your own brick wall, and how you worked it out or dealt with it. Did you start working on a project only to find a brick wall that had been hidden? Was your brick wall:

- A technological hurdle to overcome?
- Brought about by your not having sufficient knowledge of the product?
- A person?

Whatever you choose, tell us about a brick wall that you ran into and how you dealt with it (did you get help from someone/someplace? Wake up in the middle of the night with the solution?).

Most importantly, publish your post sometime on Tuesday, 2018-08-14 UTC time.
