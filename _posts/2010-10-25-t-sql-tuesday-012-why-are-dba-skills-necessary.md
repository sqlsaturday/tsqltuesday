<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">I don’t want to color people’s opinions by giving my own yet, but some things to consider are:</span>

- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">What problems have you seen in your career that could have been avoided with some DBA skills?</span>
- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">At what point does a SQL Server installation need a real DBA to look after it?</span>
- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">How could DBA input help prevent design problems in data applications?</span>
- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Should there be cross-over been developer skills and DBA skills? What about architects? Storage admins?</span>
- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">How can business continuity be affected by lack of DBA skills?</span>
- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">How much can we rely on auto-tuning to ensure performant work loads?</span>
- <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">Is Microsoft doing enough to foster DBA skills as a point of excellence?</span>
- <span style="font-size: small;">What about on other RDBMS platforms? What about no-SQL?</span>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">I could go on for hours… I’m really looking forward to seeing where you take this topic and I’m expecting some great posts.</span>
