[Invitation](http://bradsruminations.blogspot.com/2011/10/invitation-for-t-sql-tuesday-024-prox-n.html) and [roundup](http://bradsruminations.blogspot.com/2011/11/t-sql-tuesday-024-roundup.html) from [Brad Shulz](http://bradsruminations.blogspot.com/).

You are hereby invited to this month’s T-SQL Tuesday #024, which will take place on November 8, 2011.

So, all you T-SQL Bloggers out there, please join the blog party and write up something revolving around this month’s topic: **Prox ‘n’ Funx** (which is just a coo-ul way of referring to Procedures and Functions).

This topic covers a lot of ground, so there’s a myriad of possibilities in what you can write about. You could discuss a really cool stored procedure or function that you wrote. You could write about a Dynamic Management Function that you can’t live without… or perhaps write about some of the new functions that are coming in SQL2012. How about limitations or “gotchas” or performance issues in working with procedures and functions? And on and on and on…
