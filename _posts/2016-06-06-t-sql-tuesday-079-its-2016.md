[Invitation](http://michaeljswart.com/2016/06/t-sql-tuesday-079-its-2016/) and [roundup ](http://michaeljswart.com/2016/06/t-sql-tuesday-079-roundup-its-2016/)from [Michael J. Swart](http://michaeljswart.com/).

SQL Server 2016 went RTM this week and so naturally, we’re going to write about it. Here are a few writing prompts for you:

- Check out what’s new. Microsoft has written a lot about their new features. Thomas Larock has written a really nice landing page for those posts, [SQL Server 2016: It Just Runs Faster – Thomas Larock](https://thomaslarock.com/2016/06/sql-server-2016-just-runs-faster/). Look through those links. Do you feel optimistic about 2016? Or maybe a bit disappointed? Let us know either way
- Haven’t had time to download the bits, install them, explore and form thoughts on 2016 yet? Have no fear, check out [Microsoft’s Virtual Labs](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/virtuallabs). It lets you explore features without worrying about all the setup. In minutes you’ll be typing `SELECT 'hello world';`

**Still Not Inspired Eh?**

- Write a post starting with *“It’s 2016, why is this still (not) a thing?”* &lt;cough&gt;regular expressions&lt;/cough&gt;
- Think outside the box and maybe write about something besides SQL Server. Write about something you did in 2016 that would have been impossible at the same time last year.
