[Invitation](https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2019/11/t-sql-tuesday-120-what-were-you-thinking/) and [recap](https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2019/11/t-sql-tuesday-120-recap/) from [Wayne Sheffield](https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/).

Ahh, November. The [PASS Summit](https://www.pass.org/summit/2019/Home.aspx) is kicking off tonight (with several great precons going on yesterday and today). Thanksgiving is right around the corner (for everyone in the United States). Right after Thanksgiving are the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. And since this is the first Tuesday of the month, it’s time for another T-SQL Tuesday. The brainchild of Adam Machanic ([b](http://dataeducation.com/blog/)|[l](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammachanic)|[t](https://twitter.com/AdamMachanic)), and designed to strengthen the SQL Server blogging community, T-SQL Tuesday gets a lot of bloggers posting about a specific theme, chosen by the host blogger (today, that’s me). And something that is really neat is that this month wraps up the 10th year of these T-SQL Tuesday posts. Wow!

Not too long ago, I ran across a situation where I was scratching my head, wondering why something had been implemented the way it had been (you can read about it [here](https://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2018/11/what-were-you-thinking-hidden-relationship/)). And that gave me the idea for this T-SQL Tuesday topic.

In this month’s T-SQL Tuesday, I want to know about things that you’ve seen others do in SQL Server that have left you wondering “What were you thinking” (maybe even with a few #$%^&amp; thrown in)? Tell us what you saw, why you thought it was so crazy, and what you did about it (if anything). And please… just tell us what you saw, not who you saw doing it.
