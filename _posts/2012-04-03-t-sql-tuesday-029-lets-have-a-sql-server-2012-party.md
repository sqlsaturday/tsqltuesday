[Invitation](http://www.nigelpsammy.com/2012/04/t-sql-tuesday-029-lets-have-sql-server.html) from [Nigel Sammy](http://www.nigelpsammy.com/).

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yay!! It’s time for T-SQL Tuesday and this month I am hosting the party. I had another topic in mind when I asked to be a host but since the RTM occurred in March I thought it would be best to pick a topic focusing on SQL Server 2012!</span>

<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">I have been playing around with 2012 for some months now and I know for a fact that I don’t know all the new or improved features. As for the features that I actually do know, I cannot say that I am 100% sure that I fully understand all of the benefits that they provide. I don’t think that I am the only person who feels this way so I decided to pick a topic to help improve everyone knowledge of SQL Server 2012!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">This month’s topic is: What do you think is a useful feature of SQL Server 2012?</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The feature can be a new or an improved feature. I deliberately did not use the word ‘favorite’ to reduce the chance of multiple posts focusing on the same topic. I also deliberately used the word ‘useful’ to encourage bloggers to give detailed use cases and real-world examples. Remember these posts are to share knowledge and benefit the SQL community so if you want to ‘**gain access to the VIP room at the After Party**‘ then be the blogger who wrote about a useful feature that no one else covered.</span>
