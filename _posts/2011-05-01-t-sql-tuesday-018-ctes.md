[Invitation](https://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2011/04/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-18-ctes/) and [wrapup](https://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2011/05/t-sql-tuesday-18-wrapup/) from [Bob Pusateri](https://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/).

#### The Topic

This month’s topic is **CTEs**, or [Common Table Expressions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766.aspx). Had you asked me 10 years ago what CTE meant, I would have replied “[coefficient of thermal expansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion#Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion)” but that was back in my semiconductor &amp; electronic materials phase. I like the database version much better 🙂

Have you ever solved or created a problem by using CTEs? Got a tip, trick, or something nifty to share? I’d love to see your posts about any of the above. Also don’t forget that T-SQL Tuesday is not limited to only T-SQL:

> “Any post that is related to both SQL Server and the theme is fair game. So feel free to post about SSIS, SSRS, Java integration, or whatever other technologies you’re working with in conjunction with SQL Server. Even if your post includes no T-SQL we still want to see it.”
