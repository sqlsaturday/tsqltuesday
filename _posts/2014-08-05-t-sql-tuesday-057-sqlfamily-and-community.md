[Invitation](https://devjef.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/t-sql-tuesday-57-sql-family-and-community/) and [roundup](http://devjef.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/t-sql-tuesday-57-sql-family-and-community-recap/) from [Jeffrey Verheul](https://devjef.wordpress.com/).

This month I would like to give everyone the opportunity to write about SQL Family. The first time I heard of SQL Family, was on Twitter where someone mentioned this. At first I didn’t know what to think about this. I wasn’t really active in the community, and I thought it was a little weird. They were just people you meet on the internet, and might meet in person at a conference some day. But I couldn’t be more wrong about that!

<div id="wrap"><div id="content"><div id="content-left"><div class="post-1844 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-t-sql-tuesday tag-blogging tag-community tag-sqlfamily tag-t-sql-tuesday"><div class="entry">Once you start visiting events, forums, or any other involvement with the community, you’ll see I was totally wrong. I want to hear those stories. How do you feel about SQL Family? Did they help you, or did you help someone in the SQL Family? I would love to hear the stories of support, how it helped you grow and evolve, or how you would explain SQL Family to your friends and family (which I find hard). Just write about whatever topic you want, as long as it’s related to SQL Family or community.
