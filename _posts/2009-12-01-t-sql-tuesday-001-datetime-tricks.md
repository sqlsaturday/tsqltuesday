If you bothered to read the title of this post you’re aware that **the topic for this month is Date/Time Tricks**. Write a blog post that talks about dates and times–this can be based around T-SQL programming, data modeling, ETL, reporting, or whatever else you’re using dates and times for (and who isn’t?).
