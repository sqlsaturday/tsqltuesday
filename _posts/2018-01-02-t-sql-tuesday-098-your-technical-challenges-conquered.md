The current invitation (January 2017) is for T-SQL Tuesday #98. [Invitation](https://blobeater.blog/2018/01/02/t-sql-tuesday-98-your-technical-challenges-conquered/) and [round up](https://blobeater.blog/2018/01/11/t-sql-tuesday-98-round-up/) from [Arun Sirpal](https://blobeater.blog/).

Please write about and share with the world a time when you faced a technical challenge that you overcame and you can go really technical with both the issue and solution if you like.

From data recovery, tempdb contention, concurrency issues to even DTU exhaustion within Azure SQL Database – there is plenty to potentially write about.

So tell us what the issue was, your troubleshooting mind-set, how knowledge in that specific area guided you and more importantly what you did to overcome this challenging event. Hopefully with this topic we will get to read from both advanced and beginner level bloggers.

You know the saying, ***“**When the going gets tough, the tough get going”.***
