[Invitation ](http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/time-for-t-sql-tuesday-70/)and [roundup ](http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/the-tsql2sday-70-roundup/)from [Jen McCown](http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/author/jen/).

Here is your invitation for T-SQL Tuesday #70, and the topic is:

**Strategies for managing an enterprise**

We define “enterprise” in a number of ways, but I tend to default to two definitions: “the things I’m in charge of” and “anything I don’t want to do manually”. In other words, you don’t need a *large* shop to have yourself an enterprise. Of course, feel free to modify the definition to what works for you.

So. How do you manage an enterprise? Grand strategies? Tips and tricks? Techno hacks? Do tell.
