[Invitation](http://www.sqlchicken.com/2016/02/t-sql-tuesday-75-invitation-jump-into-power-bi/) and [roundup ](http://www.sqlchicken.com/2016/02/t-sql-tuesday-75-round-up/)from [Jorge Segarra](http://www.sqlchicken.com/).

Hello everyone and welcome to this month’s T-SQL Tuesday. This [![20121003200545.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/www.sqlchicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/201210032005451.jpg?resize=150%2C150)](https://i0.wp.com/www.sqlchicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/201210032005451.jpg)month’s topic is all about [Power BI](http://powerbi.com/)! If you’re reading this and thinking “crap, I’m not a BI person!”, don’t you fret. My intention is to make folks who normally don’t use BI on a day to day basis try their hand at creating cool new visualizations and reports with Power BI and seeing how the other side lives. Maybe it can spark some ideas on how you can make use of it in your operational day-to-day. For the BI folks, let’s see your creative side! What cool things can you show us with Power BI?

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to create and publish your very own Power BI report! Great news, one of the latest features of Power BI to come out is the ability to [publish your report to the web](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/publishtoweb/) so when you create and publish your report, embed it in your T-SQL Tuesday post! Here’s a couple of great examples of this feature in action:
