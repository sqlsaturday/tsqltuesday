[Invitation](http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2013/02/invitation-for-t-sql-tuesday-39-can-you-shell-what-the-posh-is-cooking/) and [recap](http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2013/02/t-sql-tuesday-39-wrapup/) from [Wayne Sheffield](http://blog.waynesheffield.com).

This month, for the first time, I’m hosting the T-SQL Tuesday Party, and you are all invited. I struggled to come up with a suitable topic (for all of 2 seconds), and decided to tie it in with the [blog series on PowerShell](http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/a-month-of-powershell/ "A Month of PowerShell") that I’m currently blogging on. So I’m asking you to blog about using PowerShell for doing, well, anything as long as it is related to SQL Server or the computer that SQL Server runs on. Scripts are encouraged, but not required. I’ll follow up with a recap of the posts about a week later.
