[Invitation](https://sqlblog.org/2018/02/06/t-sql-tuesday-99) and [roundup](https://sqlblog.org/2018/02/20/t-sql-tuesday-99-roundup) from [Aaron Bertrand](https://sqlblog.org/).

Aaron is offering a choice.

## Behind door #1:

<div>In the spirit of my revelations about still being a hockey card nerd after all these years, and after seeing [Drew Furgiuele’s great post on #sqlibirum](http://port1433.com/2017/12/13/keeping-sqlibirum-looking-back-on-what-mattered-most-this-year/), I would love to hear about something **you** are passionate about, outside of the SQL Server or tech community. Bonus points if it’s a passion that might surprise the rest of us. Play the [Zeusaphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Tesla_coil)? Forge [Samurai swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana)? Coach a [chess boxer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing) or [extreme ironer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ironing)? Maybe you dabble in [toilet seat art](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/6166)? Tell me about it! Show me proof! If you choose door #1, I hope your post is full of pictures or other media, and not just a wall of text. Let’s keep it PG, though, OK?</div>## Behind door #2:

<div>Since many of you might be uncomfortable talking about your non-technical passions, I’ll give you an escape pod back to the more familiar. I have a long laundry list of T-SQL bad habits (there’s [a big index here](https://blogs.sentryone.com/aaronbertrand/bad-habits-revival/)). What’s your favorite one? Which one do you disagree with most vehemently? What bad habits are missing from my list? This is not entrapment; I promise I’m not going to bait you into writing something just so I can argue with you. I’m really interested in reading your opinions and, also, to have more material I can point to when I talk about bad habits and/or best practices.</div>
