[Invitation](https://sqlbek.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/t-sql-tuesday-84-growing-new-speakers/) and [roundup ](https://sqlbek.wordpress.com/2016/11/15/t-sql-tuesday-84-growing-new-speakers-round-up/)from [Andy Yun](https://sqlbek.wordpress.com/).

This month’s topic is going to be about Speaking &amp; Presenting with a focus on Helping New Speakers! 4 short years ago, I attended my very first PASS Summit and never did I think I’d ever dare to become a Speaker and present. But a year later, I got coerced into a lightning talk. Since then, I’ve presented at several dozen User Groups &amp; SQL Saturdays. Tomorrow, I have the honor of presenting at PASS Summit 2016! And what an adventure it’s been!

For T-SQL Tuesday, I am giving differing topics if you are currently a Speaker or have never have spoken. And if you’ve never spoken, this T-SQL Tuesday comes with a challenge and a twist.

# **IF YOU ARE A PRESENTER: HELP NEW SPEAKERS**

If you’re a Speaker, that’s great! Your T-SQL Tuesday topic will be to write about something to Help New Speakers. Write something about Speaking to aid new Speakers.

To give you all some ideas:  
• Share insight about developing a presentation  
• Share some advice about Speaking  
• Write about your first Speaking experience  
• Share beginner tips &amp; lessons learned

# **IF YOU HAVE NEVER PRESENTED: WILL YOU TAKE UP THE CHALLENGE?**

If you’re not a Speaker, then this month’s T-SQL Tuesday is a challenge to start that journey. Start thinking about your first presentation. Think about technical topics that either you’re very comfortable with, really love, or are eager to explore, and pick one. Presentations aren’t always about sharing knowledge from an expert perspective. Many effective presentations are told from the point of a learning journey! Keep in mind that your first presentation doesn’t have to be an hour long public presentation. A 10-15 minute presentation to your coworkers is also a great way to start off!

For your T-SQL Tuesday blog post, take that topic and write about it. It can be the basis for your future presentation. Write up an outline about something you learned about recently. Or explore a problem you recently resolved at your workplace and write a starter post about it. Perhaps try your hand at writing your first demo script and blog that.

Remember, this blog post doesn’t have to encompass your entire prospective presentation. Think of it as a first draft, an exploration your idea. No need to be fancy, in-depth, or comprehensive.

If you are having difficulty deciding on a first presentation topic, no problem! Why not write about the topic(s) you are considering? Explore each one at a high level, and why they interest you.

Still on the fence about Speaking? Feel free to write a non-technical blog post about that too! You could explore and share your thoughts about presenting and even explore any concerns you may find yourself having.

This T-SQL Tuesday is all about helping you to start your journey to giving your first presentation.

# **THE TWIST: I WANT TO HELP**

Here’s this month’s T-SQL Tuesday twist. If you’ve never presented before and take me up on this challenge, I or another experienced speaker volunteer, will take the time to privately provide feedback to each and every one of you.

• If you want help developing your first presentation out, I will help you.  
• If you are wary of putting your first PowerPoint together, I will help you.  
• If you need ideas on how to write demo scripts, I will help you.

I will do whatever I can to help you begin this journey. Feel free to reach out to me prior to T-SQL Tuesday, if you want feedback on where to start. Otherwise, I will reach out after your blog post goes live, to keep the fire alive and help you take the next steps!
