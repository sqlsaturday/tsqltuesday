[Invitation](http://sqlity.net/en/2559/tsql2sday-58-invite/) and [roundup](http://sqlity.net/en/2566/tsql2sday-58-roundup/) from [Sebastian Meine](http://sqlity.net/en/blog/).

<div class="hfeed" id="wrapper"><div class="inner contentpage"><div class="colthreefourths leftcol"><div>This time the T-SQL Tuesday topic is: Passwords. Anything that you can think of, that has to do with or is related to passwords is a welcome topic. To give you a few ideas about what you could write, I compiled a short list of possible topics:

- [How do you pick a good password?](http://sqlity.net/en/2361/good-passwords/)
- How do you remember all your passwords?
- Tell a password story or [draw a cartoon](http://www.networkcomputing.com/cartoon-daily-drill/d/d-id/1234811?image_number=1).
- [Did a password once change your life?](https://medium.com/@manicho/how-a-password-changed-my-life-7af5d5f28038)

Those topics are not really SQL Server related, so you might argue that they do not fit a T-SQL Tuesday. I think that they still would make valuable posts, but in case, you want to play it “closer to home”, here are a few more ideas:

- How do you manage all the SA and application passwords in your organization?
- [How do you or should you store passwords in your database?](http://sqlity.net/en/2460/sql-password-hash/)
- [How do you enforce password hygiene for SQL Logins in your environment?](http://sqlity.net/en/2455/pwdcompare/)
- Did you once write an application (or procedure) that made use of the password hashes in [sys.sql\_logins](http://sqlity.net/en/2327/sys-sql_logins/)

And, if you still think that “passwords” is not a fitting topic for T-SQL Tuesday, write about why you think so.
