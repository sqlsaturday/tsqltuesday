Technology has changed a lot in the past years, especially with cloud/globalization/automation. What an impact has this had on your job? Do you feel endangered? Or do you have more exciting features/toys to work with? Do you embrace the change and learn new skills? Or do you hide in your cubicle and fear the robot uprising? Let us know how you handle all these changes, or how you feel there are no changes at all for your current job. Iâ€™m looking forward to learn how you feel about the future of data management/analysis and how you plan to deal with it.
