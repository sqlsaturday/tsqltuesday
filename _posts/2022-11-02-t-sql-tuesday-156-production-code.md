[Invitation](https://straightforwardsql.com/posts/production-code/) from [Tom Zika](https://straightforwardsql.com/).

I’m a learner by example, so when I started programming (not so long ago), I tried to find existing solutions on various Q&amp;A sites or blogs, as one might.

After a while, I noticed one sentence repeating often enough that it stuck with me:

> “This is not a production-grade code”.

So here’s my invitation: **“Which quality makes code production grade?”**

You might think: *“Production code is code that runs in production, duh.”*

But let’s help out the newbies who look for a bit of concrete guidance.  
Please be as specific as possible with your examples and include your reasoning.

I’m not limiting the scope to just the SQL; it can be anything.
