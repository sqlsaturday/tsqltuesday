[Invitation](https://www.bronowski.it/blog/2021/02/t-sql-tuesday-135-the-outstanding-tools-of-the-trade-that-make-your-job-awesome/) and [write-up](https://www.bronowski.it/blog/2021/02/t-sql-tuesday-135-the-outstanding-tools-of-the-trade-that-make-your-job-awesome-write-up/) from [Mikey Bronowski](https://www.bronowski.it/blog/)

## TL;DR

Without tools, most of the work would be much harder to do or could not be done at all. Write a blog post about the most helpful and effective tools you use or know of.

If you do not own the blog – Tweet your contribution or post on LinkedIn with [\#tsql2sday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tsql2sday) and put the link back in the comments here.

## Tools are great

Can you imagine your day without them? How do you make your coffee or slice the bread? How do you cook breakfast or dinner?

We are surrounded by tools, and there is a special class of them called “tools of the trade”. Those are needed to do your job whatever it is.

I would like you to write about the tools that help you at work, those that helped you the most or were the most effective. It can by anything really, does not have to be related to SQL at all. Here is the list of example, but you can go beyond that and share the tools you cannot live without. Are you…

- writing code?
- recording videos or streaming live sessions?
- creating podcasts or taking pictures?
- migrating loads of data or environments?
- writing documentation?
- maintaining the open-source projects?
- managing the team?
- travelling a lot (well, not currently)?
- learning a new language?
- renovating house?

Everyone has its own experience and workstyle. The goal of this post is for everyone to learn about a new tool, or starting to use one, so life gets easier a little bit.
