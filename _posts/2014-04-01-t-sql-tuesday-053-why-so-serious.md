</div>Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to come up with a piece of T-SQL that could mess with your coworkers. And if you’re committed to the fun, implement it!

Need some ideas? Maybe you could…

- Write a lengthy script that returns a funny or annoying message
- Implement hilarious login triggers
- Use Resource Govenor to limit your <del>victims</del> developers

Honestly the sky is the limit. Just be sure to blog about the results of your trickery if you do pull it off.

### Special Warning

Folks, don’t get yourself fired. This is meant to be fun. But you know your work environment better than I do. If your job has a stick up its rear-end, just write your tricks down and keep them up your sleeve for when you’re working at a more relaxed place.

And I shouldn’t have to say it, but **don’t do this sh!t in Production**.
