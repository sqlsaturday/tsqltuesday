[Invitation ](https://voiceofthedba.com/2021/04/06/tsql2sday-137-invite-using-notebooks-every-day/)and [wrap-up](http://voiceofthedba.com/2021/04/23/t-sql-tuesday-137-wrap-up/) from [Steve Jones](http://voiceofthedba.com/).

## Jupyter Notebooks

I first heard about [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) years ago. At the time I was just getting started in Python and I thought these were a great way to share code online with others. However, the setup and administration was a pain, and I quickly gave up.

When I saw Microsoft add [notebooks to Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/), I got slightly excited again, but once again, it was a bit of a pain to work with these. Too much administrative overhead, in my opinion.

That changed a bit with [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15), which has seen notebooks get added, and become easier and more stable. If you haven’t tried notebooks, get ADS and give it a try today. I even wrote [a short piece](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/using-notebooks-in-azure-data-studio) on using these.

## Your Invitation

For this month’s T-SQL Tuesday, I want you to write about how you have used, or would like to use, a Jupyter notebook. This seemed to be exciting for many people at first, but I haven’t seen a lot of uptake from users in general. So I’m curious if you are using them.

A few resources for you:

- [Using Jupyter Notebooks in ADS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/notebooks/notebooks-guidance?view=sql-server-ver15)
- [Knowledge Sharing with SQL Notebooks](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/sql-tools/knowledge-sharing-with-sql-notebooks/)
- [Running Jupyter Notebooks as Agent Jobs](https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2020/03/30/running-jupyter-notebooks-as-agent-jobs/)
- [Building and sharing Jupyter Books in Azure Data Studio](https://argonsys.com/microsoft-cloud/library/building-and-sharing-jupyter-books-in-azure-data-studio/)

There is even a way to [run these from PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sqlserver/invoke-sqlnotebook?view=sqlserver-ps).

So let me know how you are using notebooks, or your plans for the future.
