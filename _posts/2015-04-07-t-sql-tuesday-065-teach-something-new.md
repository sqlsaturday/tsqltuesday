<div class="content-background"><div class="wrapper"><div id="content"><div class="post-1404 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-sql-server tag-tsql2sday tag-sql-server" id="post-1404"><div class="entry clear">The topic this month is straight forward, but very open ended. <span id="more-1404"></span>You must learn something new and then write a blog post explaining it. One of the reasons I present and blog is because it forces me to really learn a subject if I am going to explain it to someone else. I am now giving all of you that same opportunity. You’re welcome.

I considered limiting this to just T-SQL, but that seemed….limiting. It just has to be something SQL related and also small enough that you can explain in a single blog post. Maybe a T-SQL command or DMV you have been meaning to learn more about or an SSIS component or PowerShell commandlet you’ve never used before. Try not to make it too theoretical I want some code snippets or screen shots. OK. We’ll meet back here on the internets in a week and all have some new knowledge.
