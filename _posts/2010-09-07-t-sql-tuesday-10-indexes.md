[Invitation](http://michaeljswart.com/2010/09/invitation-to-participate-in-t-sql-tuesday-10-indexes/) and [roundup ](http://michaeljswart.com/?p=905)from [Michael J. Swart](http://michaeljswart.com/).

Indexes are strange things. You never need to explicitly create one to create a fully-functional database, but if you want a database to perform well, they’re indispensable.

And there are so many aspects to write about! Like internals, covering, clustered, xml, fulltext, b-trees, hints, maintenance of, included columns, filtered, redundant, missing and tons more.

In fact my *[SQL Server 2008 Administrator’s Pocket Consultant](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Server-Administrators-Pocket-Consultant/dp/0735624372/ "amazon's page")* (The first handy textbook I could grab) has an index entry on “*indexes*” that has 22 sub-entries.
