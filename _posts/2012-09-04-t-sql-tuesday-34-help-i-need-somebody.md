[Invitation ](https://weblogs.sqlteam.com/robv/2012/09/04/t-sql-tuesday-34-help-i-need-somebody-again/)from Rob Volk.

## n the beginning…

  
SQL Server has changed a lot since I started with it. **&lt;Cranky Old Guy&gt;***Back in my day, [Books Online](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms130214.aspx) was neither. There were no [blogs](http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/). [Google](http://www.google.com/) was the third-place search site. There were perhaps two or three [community](http://www.sqlteam.com/forums/default.asp)[forums](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/) where you could ask questions. (Besides the [Microsoft newsgroups](http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx)…which you had to access with [Usenet](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CEoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUsenet&ei=iQpGUMzIIIPs9AS304HwAg&usg=AFQjCNGzlhULzaVSxjkqcltiZN8u2LekTw&sig2=M8v6N0QC8KDYDl9D1yTBGw). And endure the wrath of…[Celko](http://www.simple-talk.com/author/joe-celko/).) Your “training” was reading a [book](http://goo.gl/IZ1Pc), made from real dead trees, that you bought from your choice of brick-and-mortar bookstore. And except for your [local user groups](http://www.atlantamdf.com/), there were no [conferences](http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2012), [seminars](http://dataeducation.com/), [SQL Saturdays](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/), or any [online video hookups](http://www.sqlpass.org/24hours/) where you could interact with a person. You’d have to call [Microsoft Support](http://support.microsoft.com/)…on the phone…a [LANDLINE phone](http://i.imgur.com/jk1on.jpg). And none of this “[SQL Family](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23sqlfamily)” business!***&lt;/Cranky Old Guy&gt;**

Even now, with all these excellent resources available, it’s still daunting for a beginner to seek help for SQL Server. The product is roughly 1247.4523 times larger than it was 15 years ago, and it’s simply impossible to know everything about it.[\*](http://www.sqlskills.com/) So whether you are a beginner, or a seasoned pro of over a decade’s experience, what do you do when you need help on SQL Server?
