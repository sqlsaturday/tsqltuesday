[Invitation](http://dataeducation.com/t-sql-tuesday-21-a-day-late-and-totally-full-of-it/) from [Adam Machanic](http://dataeducation.com/blog/).

“This ugly hack is only temporary,” you think. Six months later, a coworker curses your name, sacrificing a chicken to any deity that will help expedite your getting struck down by lightning, a school bus, or both.

**Crap code.** We’ve all seen it. We’ve all created it. We’re all guilty. **Yes, even you.** Sometimes our crap is purposeful—the ugly, “temporary” hack. Sometimes we produce crap because we simply don’t know any better. But there is no excuse good enough. As professionals, we must strive to rid ourselves of bad habits. And the only way to learn the difference is to see lots, and lots, and lots of examples.

That’s where you come in. **This month’s T-SQL Tuesday challenge: reveal your crap to the world**. Why is (or was) it crap? Why did you do it? And how did you learn from your mistake?
