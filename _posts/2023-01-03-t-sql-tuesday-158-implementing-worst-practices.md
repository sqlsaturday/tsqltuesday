[Invitation](https://www.sqldoubleg.com/2023/01/02/t-sql-tuesday-158-implementing-worst-practices/) from Raul Gonzalez.

One of the most repeated answers to almost any question asked within the SQL Server community is that ‚Äúeverything depends‚Äù‚Ä¶ Can that also apply to known best practices?

Furthermore, is it possible that some of the commonly agreed ‚Äúworst practices‚Äù have indeed some use case where they can be useful or suit an edge use case?

This month I am asking you to write about those not-so-common practices that you may have implemented at some point and the reasons behind it, I have a few in my pocket that will make more than one a bit uncomfortable ![üòÄ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f600.svg)
