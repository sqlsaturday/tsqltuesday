[Invitation](https://debthedba.wordpress.com/2022/07/05/t-sql-tuesday-152-invitation/) and [round up](https://debthedba.wordpress.com/2022/07/19/t-sql-tuesday-152-round-up/) from Deborah Melkin.

I came to a realization lately that I have a few opinions about databases. And I’m pretty sure that you do too. After all, I’ve read your blogs, chatted with you, and seen your Twitter rants.

But we’re database professionals. It’s supposed to depend, right?

Except we all have experiences that shape how we approach our work. One minute your coworker asks you a question about doing X. You reply with “It Depends…” leading into a 5-10 minute rant. This may include some or all of the following:

- Stories starting with “that one time at that client”
- References to blog posts you read\\wrote\\should write
- Commentary on code – the good, the bad, &amp; the ugly
- Personal theories and philosophies on the topic

All of this is followed by “Thank you for coming to my [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks)” and a “I’m sorry, what was your question again?

So yeah… this may have been inspired by an actual conversation… or two… or ten. I apologize to my coworkers… again…

So for this month’s T-SQL Tuesday, I want you to give us that rant. Tell us about the experiences, the code, the posts that inspired you, and all the gory details in between. And what is it that makes you so passionate about this topic that “It Depends” gets tossed out the window? Pull out your soapbox and tell us all about it
