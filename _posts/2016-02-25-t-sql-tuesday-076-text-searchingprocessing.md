[Invitation](http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2016/02/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-76-text-searchingprocessing/) and [wrap-up](http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2016/03/t-sql-tuesday-76-wrap-up/) from [Bob Pusateri](http://www.bobpusateri.com/).

This month, I’d like to talk about text, particularly searching and processing it. Many systems contain large amounts of text in one way or another. Often, that text ends up being stored in a database, and SQL Server has offered Full-Text Search for quite a while now to handle such usage cases. But that’s only a small part of the story.

If you’re using SQL Server Full-Text Search, I’d love to hear from you. But I’d also love to hear from anyone using any other kind of text searching or processing methods. Maybe your organization previously used SQL Server Full-Text Search but you’ve since moved to a different application. Maybe you have a tale of success or woe from a previous job. Maybe you don’t let any of your text search operations touch a relational database with a 10-foot pole. Whatever your story is, I hope you’ll please consider sharing it with us all on Tuesday, March 8.
