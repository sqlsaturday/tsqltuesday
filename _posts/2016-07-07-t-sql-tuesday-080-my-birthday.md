[Invitation](http://www.toadworld.com/platforms/sql-server/b/weblog/archive/2016/07/06/t-sql-tuesday-080) and [roundup ](https://chrisyatessql.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/t-sql-tuesday-080-round-up/#respond)from [Chris Yates](http://www.toadworld.com/members/chris-yates).

T-SQL Tuesday time is here again! And I’m honored to be hosting this months block party. Why you ask? T-SQL Tuesday #80 happens to fall on my birthday believe it or not!

With that said let’s get this party started and have some fun with it this month shall we. Treat yourself to a birthday gift and come up with a present for yourself SQL related – no limitations:

- Is there something you’ve been wanting to do for a long time in SQL, but haven’t done it yet?
- Perhaps there is a feature you would like to see added into SQL that just isn’t there yet – what is it?
- Maybe you are a consultant and know something many of us don’t as you parachute in and out of shops that a reader can benefit from?
- Is there a co-worker struggling with something SQL related; here is your chance to share the present (knowledge).

Gift wrap your post for yourself and be innovative with what you write about.
