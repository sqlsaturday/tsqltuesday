This month’s [invitation ](https://tracyboggiano.com/archive/2019/07/t-sql-tuesday-116-sql-on-linux/)and [roundup](https://tracyboggiano.com/archive/2019/07/t-sql-tuesday-116-roundup-sql-on-linux/) is from [Tracy Boggiano](https://tracyboggiano.com/).

Ever since Microsoft said SQL would run on Linux, I was excited. Finally, all the Linux administrators I had worked with could be quiet and the Oracle DBAs that said they were multi-platform. I organized the PASS Linux Marathon back in December 2017 and started the website, [WeSpeakLinux](http://wespeaklinux.com/), in efforts to help people learn more Linux skills (including myself) as Linux is different than running Windows. While I know it takes a while to adopt new technologies; I was wondering what it would take for people to adopt SQL on Linux. Alternating I’m offering up for you to blog about what everyone should know when working with SQL on Linux or anything else related to SQL running on Linux.
