[Invitation](https://www.cathrinewilhelmsen.net/2015/05/05/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-66-monitoring/) and [roundup ](https://www.cathrinewilhelmsen.net/2015/05/19/roundup-of-t-sql-tuesday-66-monitoring/)from [Catherine Wilhelmsen](https://www.cathrinewilhelmsen.net).

<div id="content"><div id="main"><article class="post-2634 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-sql-server tag-monitoring tag-t-sql-tuesday" id="post-2634"><div class="entry-content">The topic of the month is *monitoring*. We all monitor something while working with SQL Server: Maybe you’re a DBA who monitors database performance, an SSIS developer who monitors job and package execution, an application developer who monitors queries or a BI analyst who monitors report usage? Do you use T-SQL or PowerShell scripts? Have you created your own monitoring reports or applications? Have you invested in a complete monitoring solution from a vendor? What is monitored manually and what is automated with alerts? If a brand new SQL Server professional in your role asks you for advice, what do you say is the number one most important thing to monitor? Have you ever stayed awake for a week solving a problem that could have been avoided with proper monitoring? Did you implement a monitoring solution that saved your company?

Be creative! There are so many topics to choose from, and you can of course write about anything you want as long as it is related to SQL Server and monitoring. It doesn’t matter if you’re new to SQL Server or have decades of experience, whether your blog post is short or long, an introduction or a deep dive, if you include scripts or screen shots… Just join the party and have fun while you share your knowledge. (And if you joined the [\#SQLNewBlogger](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23SQLNewBlogger) challenge in April, this is a great way to keep blogging!)
