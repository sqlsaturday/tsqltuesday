[Invitation](https://sqlasylum.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-15-automation-in-sql-server/) and [Summary](https://sqlasylum.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/t-sql-tuesday-15-summary/) from Pat Wright.

Having taken part in several T-SQL Tuesday’s I decided I would finally put my name in to host one. I figured it would be a good way to lose my sanity learn some great ideas from this wonderful SQL community. I figured that since many of you out there set a goal this year to blog more and to learn Powershell then this Topic should help in both of those goals. So the topic I have chosen for this month is Automation! It can be **Automation** with T-SQL or with Powershell or a mix of both. Give us your best tips/tricks and ideas for making our lives easier through Automation. Now here are all the details you’ll need for a successful T-SQL Tuesday post!
