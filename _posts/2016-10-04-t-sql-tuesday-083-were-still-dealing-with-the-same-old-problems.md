[Invitation](http://am2.co/2016/10/t-sql-tuesday-83/) and [roundup ](http://am2.co/2016/10/t-sql-tuesday-83-roundup/)from [Andy M. Mallon](https://www.am2.co/).

At the end of August, Allan Hirt ([blog](http://sqlha.com/author/allanhirt/)|[twitter](https://twitter.com/sqlha)) tweeted:

"In the roughly 25 years of I have been in IT, we’re still dealing with the same problems."

I proceeded to flood Twitter with [a bunch of things that IT has been messing up for years](https://www.am2.co/2016/10/the-same-problems/). At the end of my tweetstorm, I realized it would be a wonderful topic of T-SQL Tuesday.

Of course, because this is **T-SQL** Tuesday, let’s put a database-centric spin on Allan’s original tweet. For this month’s topic, I offer two fill-in-the-blank topics:

- In the &lt;N&gt; years I have been a database professional, we’re still dealing with &lt;some problem&gt;
- In the &lt;N&gt; years I have been using SQL Server, we’re still dealing with &lt;some problem&gt;

Whatever your problem, this month is a chance to give your [stump speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_speech_(politics) ), and raise some awareness about it. Perhaps we can even make some progress in fixing some of these problems.
