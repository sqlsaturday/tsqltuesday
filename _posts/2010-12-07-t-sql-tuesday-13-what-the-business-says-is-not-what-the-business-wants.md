[Invitation](https://voiceofthedba.com/2010/12/07/t-sql-tuesday-13-what-the-business-says-is-not-what-the-business-wants/) and [roundup ](https://voiceofthedba.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/t-sql-tuesday-13-roundup/)from [Steve Jones](https://voiceofthedba.com).

I was giving a presentation recently and someone in the audience started to ask about why I recommended against a certain technique. Without getting into it, this person kept saying that she had to implement things her way since the “business” said they needed it done that way. However a little digging showed that the business didn’t really understand the technology. They were asking for a result, and she took them literally in how she implemented a process. A classic impedance mismatch.

I think we’ve all had situations that are similar. The business, the client, the customer, is asking for something, but they don’t know how to ask those of us building the technology. Or they don’t understand the implications of asking for something like “absolutely zero data loss” to be implemented.

The official topic this month is:

What issues have you had in interacting with the business to get your job done.
