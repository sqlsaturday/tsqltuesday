[Invitation ](https://bweissman.de/index.php/2021/06/01/t-sql-tuesday-139-the-data-world-is-hybrid/)from [Ben Weissman](https://bweissman.de/).

Our data estates are not just on premises anymore. And they haven’t all moved to the cloud either.

New offerings for a hybrid world like [Azure Arc-enabled Data Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc/hybrid-data-services/) pop up but are far from being widely used in production environments.

It has become pretty evident to me, that we’ll be living in a hybrid world for a long time – potentially indefinitely. But what does that mean for our data strategy?

**My Invitation**

On this month’s #tsql2sday, I would therefore like to invite you all to share your hybrid and edge experiences!

Where are you on your journey?

Which challenges did you face?

How did you address them?
