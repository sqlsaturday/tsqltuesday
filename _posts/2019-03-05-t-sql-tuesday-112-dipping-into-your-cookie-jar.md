[Invitation](https://nocolumnname.blog/2019/03/05/t-sql-tuesday-112-dipping-into-your-cookie-jar/) and [roundup](https://nocolumnname.blog/2019/03/21/t-sql-tuesday-112-roundup/) from Shane O’Neil

I’ve been listening to audio-books on the way into work, and the current one struck a cord with me.

It’s [“Can’t Hurt Me” by David Goggins](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Cant-Hurt-Me-Audiobook/B07KKNG85B) and it is about his story from a rough upbringing “*into a US Armed Forces icon and one of the world’s top endurance athletes*“.

One part of the story that has stuck in my mind is where he talks about “*dipping into the cookie jar*“. It’s an analogy that is easy to follow when you understand it.

Dipping into the Cookie Jar is about when the going gets tough and you don’t think you can handle anymore, then you think back about your accomplishments and take some sustenance from them. You dip back into that cookie jar and use whatever energy that provides to keep going.

Things are going to be tough for everyone at some stage or another. There are going to be low points spread out among the highs. While I know that reaching out to the SQL Family is an amazing external resource to help lift the members up, I think it’s also important for people to remember those accomplishments and realise that they have an internal resource as well.

That is what I want from the contributors of this T-SQL Tuesday, those memories that they can think back on for sustenance. Like the humble cookie, I want a humble brag.

## Share some cookies

This month’s T-SQL Tuesday is about finding those cookies and sharing them.

These cookies do not have to be massive. Like the various cookies out there, they can be big or small – [or even technical](http://www.whatarecookies.com/).

So tell me about a time when you had an accomplishment that can keep you going.

- About the time you made your first server specification for a new SQL Server instance.
- About the first time you wrote out the syntax for a Recursive CTE by memory.
- About the time you knew the answer to a technology question from someone else.
- About after all the study you passed the certificate you were after.
- About the time you created a PowerShell script, or a Python script, etc. and it worked.
- About the time you created a PowerShell script, or a Python script, etc. and it didn’t work but you were able to fix it.
- About how you inherited an unorganised instance and made improvements to it.
- About how you stood, trembling and scared for your first presentation, but you did it in the end.

The above “cookies” are all technical but your ones don’t have to be. Whatever your favourite cookie is, let me know.
