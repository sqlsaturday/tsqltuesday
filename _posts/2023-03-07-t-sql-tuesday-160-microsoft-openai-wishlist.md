[Invitation](https://amazonwebshark.com/t-sql-tuesday-160-microsoft-openai-wishlist/) and [round-up](https://amazonwebshark.com/t-sql-tuesday-160-round-up/) from Damien Jones.

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has been a big deal in recent months. One of the main drivers of this has been [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), whose [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) services have seen extraordinary public interest and participation.

ChatGPT is currently [the fastest-growing consumer application in history](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/) It [reached 100 million users](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app) in its first two months, and has been integrated into numerous applications. One such example is the [recent version](https://dbeaver.io/2023/02/05/dbeaver-22-3-4/) of [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) that I tried out [in my previous post](https://amazonwebshark.com/dbeaver-openai-chatgpt-integration/).

Microsoft has been one of OpenAI’s most prominent supporters. In July 2019 Microsoft [invested $1 billion](https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/) in OpenAI and became their exclusive cloud provider.

In January 2023 Microsoft announced the latest phase of its [multibillion-dollar investment partnership](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) with OpenAI and [the general availability of Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/general-availability-of-azure-openai-service-expands-access-to-large-advanced-ai-models-with-added-enterprise-benefits/). Since then, Microsoft announced that [it is building AI technology](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/) into Microsoft Bing, Edge and Microsoft 365.

My invitation for this month’s T-SQL Tuesday is:
