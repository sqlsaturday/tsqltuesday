[Invitation](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/come-one-come-all-to/) and [SUM()](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/sum-t-sql-tuesday-016/) from [Jes Borland](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/author/grrlgeek/).

## The Topic: Aggregation

No, not aggravation (although I’ve used the two interchangably before). I want to hear how you solved business problems with aggregate functions. I want to see your cool T-SQL tricks. How are aggregates used in SSRS, SSAS, or SSIS? What have you learned about aggregate functions?

Let’s SUM(thoughts), COUNT(ways we’ve done things), and set MAX(awesome) on our posts!

Remember: “any post that is related to both SQL Server and the theme is fair game. So feel free to post about SSIS, SSRS, Java integration, or whatever other technologies you’re working with in conjunction with SQL Server. Even if your post includes no T-SQL we still want to see it.”
