[Invitation](http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2013/04/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-41-presenting-and-loving-it/) and [recap](http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2013/04/t-sql-tuesday-41-recap/) from [Bob Pusteri](http://www.bobpusateri.com/).

 This month the prompt is **how did you come to love presenting?** What was the first time you gave a presentation in front of a group **and really enjoyed it**? Was it something that was required of you in school? Something you did in the workplace? Were you inspired by other SQL community members and thought “I think I can do that too”? Whatever your story is, I’d love to hear it. **Not a presenter? Not a problem!** Feel free to chime in with whatever you like that’s related to either presenting or SQL Server in general.
