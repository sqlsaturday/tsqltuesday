## Big Data

[![godiva](https://voiceofthedba.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/godiva.jpg?w=244&h=244 "godiva")](http://www.godiva.com/product/15-pc-valentines-day-heart-gift-box/id/2542.gdv?SE_Section=Shop&SE_Category=86&lastCat=86)The party falls on [Valentine’s Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day) this month, and I thought a little notice would let you get your post done early, and then spend the day with your loved ones

Since the media has [a love affair with Big Data](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=big+data) right now, I thought this would make an interesting topic. Data is the lifeblood of our careers and of many organizations. Slowly governments, companies, and individuals are becoming aware of just how important data is to us, and as they do, they want more of it. More storage, more access, and more analysis.

That creates challenges for us as data professionals. We will have to learn to better manipulate, aggregate, summarize, and handle larger volumes of data in the future. I think this means we will have lots of employment in this area, and it means tremendous opportunity for those that learn to work with data well.

This month I want to hear what big data problems you’ve solved, or interesting ways of working with big data, challenges that you struggle with, or cool hardware tricks that mask the problems in your code.

Think big, and let us know how you work with Big Data.
