[Invitation](http://www.kendalvandyke.com/2013/10/t-sql-tuesday-47-your-best-sql-server.html) from [Kendal Van Dyke](http://www.kendalvandyke.com/). No roundup.

Conferences are great for learning and catching up with friends and #SQLFamily…but let’s admit it – we all like to roam the vendor halls to score free stuff, too! Some things we grab to bring back to the office, user group, or family at home; every now and then you pick something up and say, “no way anyone’s getting their hands on this!”

For this month’s topic we’re going to have a little fun. I want to hear the story about the best SQL Server swag you’ve ever received. No cheap tchotchkes here – we want to know about the *good* stuff. Tell us when, where, and how you got it. Make sure to include a picture, too, because you know you want to make the rest of envious at your prize SWAG!
