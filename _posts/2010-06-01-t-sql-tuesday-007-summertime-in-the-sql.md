[Invitation](http://www.sqlchicken.com/2010/06/t-sql-tuesday-007-summertime-in-the-sql/) and [roundup](http://www.sqlchicken.com/2010/06/t-sql-tuesday-007-roundup/) from [Jorge Segarra](http://www.sqlchicken.com/).

In the last few months we’ve had the release of SQL Server 2008 R2 which brought along with it a [slew of new features](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb500435.aspx). So this T-SQL Tuesday I ask: What’s your favorite hot new feature in the R2 (I’ll be nice and include 2008 in general) release? Got some code that takes advantage of a new feature? Post it! Got an example of how PowerPivot let you slice and dice data you simply couldn’t before due to contraints? Show us! Make sure to apply your SPF 1433 and get to writing.
