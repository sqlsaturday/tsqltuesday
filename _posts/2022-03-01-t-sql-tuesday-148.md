[Invitation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/t-sql-tuesday-advice-on-running-a-user-group/ba-p/3213699) from [Rie Merritt](http://www.riepedia.net/).

For this edition of T-SQL Tuesday, I’d like to ask everyone to write about all the various aspects of running a user group. I’m not asking you to write a James Michener novel that starts at the beginning of time and includes everything a user group leader needs to know. Specifically, I’m asking people to pick one or two things and go deep on what works for you, what didn’t work for you and lessons learned. Running a user group is a large umbrella of tasks and duties: be it in-person, virtual or hybrid. My goal this month is to break that up into small bite sized pieces of knowledge for people. There are so many directions you can go here: finding speakers, growing your membership, utilizing technology to make things easier, finding sponsors, finding a venue, picking a pattern to when you meet, etc. The possibilities are almost endless!

The [Azure Data Community](https://aka.ms/datacommunity) is building a How to run a user group wiki and we’d love to link to your post to offer new and old user group leaders some great resources to build and maintain a successful, healthy community.

Special thanks to [Steve Jones](https://twitter.com/way0utwest) for running T-SQL Tuesday and finding a spot for me, thanks to [Kenneth Fisher](https://twitter.com/sqlstudent144) for being flexible with when he sponsors T-SQL Tuesday and finally to [John Morehouse](https://twitter.com/sqlrus), [Annette Allen](https://twitter.com/Mrs_Fatherjack) and [Josh Smith](https://twitter.com/SQLDeployHelmet) for all of the sweat equity they’ve already put into building the wiki.
