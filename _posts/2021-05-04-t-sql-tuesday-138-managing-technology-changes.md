[Invitation ](https://andyleonard.blog/2021/05/t-sql-tuesday-138-managing-technology-changes/)and [wrap-up](https://andyleonard.blog/2021/05/t-sql-tuesday-138-managing-technology-changes-wrap-up/) from [Andy Leonard](https://andyleonard.blog/).

One point I make (repeatedly) in my latest book – titled [Building Custom Tasks for SQL Server Integration Services](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1484264819/) – is “software changes.” In fact, software changed *on me* between the completion of editing and the release of the book! I wrote about the changes in a post titled [Building Custom Tasks for SSIS Second Edition Errata, Chapters 1-9](https://andyleonard.blog/2021/02/building-custom-tasks-for-ssis-second-edition-errata-chapters-1-9/). There’s a live stream video at the bottom of that post, as well.

Changing software inspired this month’s T-SQL Tuesday topic:

**“How Do You Respond When Technology Changes Under You?”**
