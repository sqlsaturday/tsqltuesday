[Invitation ](https://tjaybelt.blogspot.com/2021/08/t-sql-tuesday-141-worklife-balance.html)and [wrap up](https://tjaybelt.blogspot.com/2021/08/t-sql-tuesday-141-worklife-balance-wrap.html) from [TJay Belt](https://tjaybelt.blogspot.com/).

Having gone thru this last year of strange upheaval around the world, I’ve been thinking about this topic quite a bit lately. My company has a mentor program where one can sign up and discuss this topic. I signed up. I’ve had several ‘sessions’ with my mentor. We’ve had some productive conversations about what this all means to me, my career, my skillset, and so on.  
As I transitioned to work at home, some 500 days ago, it was a shift in perspective, timing, and many things. Trying to keep those scales balanced has been a focus and a struggle from time to time. Especially recently, but throughout my career, it’s a topic I often lapse back into. Trying to find that balance.

***My invitation*** to you for this month’s #tsql2sday is…

I want to invite you to share your experiences dealing with your own personal journey with **Work/Life Balance**, either thru experience, or hopeful future goals…

- What are the cool things have you learned?
- What things did you try, that simply didn’t work out?
- What rules have you implemented that made it easier to balance?
- What rules made it harder to find that balance?
- What are tips or tricks can you share to help others?
