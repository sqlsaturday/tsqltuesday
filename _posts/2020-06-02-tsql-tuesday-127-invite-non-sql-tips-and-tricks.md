[Invitation](https://sqlstudies.com/2020/06/02/tsql-tuesday-127-invite-non-sql-tips-and-tricks/) from [Ken Fisher](https://sqlstudies.com/).

How about for this months TSQL Tuesday let’s do another month of tips and tricks. But just to be a bit different, nothing to do with SQL Server (in fact let’s say nothing related to a DBMS). No SSMS tricks, no T-SQL tips, something completely unrelated. For example did you know that, in Windows, if you grab a window and shake it then all of the other windows will be minimized? And then if you shake it again they all pop back up.

So give me a non SQL related tip or trick. OS (windows, mac), Cloud (Azure, AWS), etc. Something you think will be handy for the rest of us.

##### What is T-SQL Tuesday

T-SQL Tuesday is a blog party started by Adam Machanic ([b/](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/)[t](http://twitter.com/adammachanic)) over a decade ago and now maintained by Steve Jones ([blog](https://voiceofthedba.wordpress.com/)|[twitter](https://twitter.com/way0utwest)) on [tsqltuesday.com](http://tsqltuesday.com/). The first Tuesday of each month a blogger hosts the party and suggests a topic. Then anyone who is interested blogs on that topic. It can be a lot of fun and quite a challenge to blog on a topic you didn’t pick. Not to mention the time limit. I didn’t mention the time limit? Oh, well, you have one week to write your blog and then it has to be posted on the second Tuesday of the month.
