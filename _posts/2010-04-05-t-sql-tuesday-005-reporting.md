[Invitation ](http://sqlvariant.com/2010/04/t-sql-tuesday-005-reporting/)and [roundup](http://sqlvariant.com/2010/04/t-sql-tuesday-005-reporting-the-round-up/) from [Aaron Nelson](http://sqlvariant.com).

Reporting is a potentially huge topic so here are just a handful of ideas that might get you started:

- Server Performance Reporting
- Technologies to help offload reporting
- Reporting services tricks
- T-SQL tricks for presentation and formatting
- Database design considerations for reporting
- Self-service reports
- Reports for executives
- Reporting from Oracle in SSRS

Don’t forget that the DMVs are pretty much qualified as ‘Reports’ so those count too!
