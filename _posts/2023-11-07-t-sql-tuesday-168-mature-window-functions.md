 [Invitation](https://voiceofthedba.com/2023/11/07/t-sql-tuesday-168-mature-window-functions/) and [roundup](https://voiceofthedba.com/2023/11/21/t-sql-tuesday-168-roundup/) from [Steve Jones](https://voiceofthedba.com/).

We’ve had window functions in SQL Server for a decade now, since SQL Server 2012.

This month I’m asking you to write on how window functions have made your life easier. A few ideas for you:

- What problems have you solved with a window function? Bonus points for lead/lag/first\_value/last\_value
- Have you used the SQL Server 2022 enhancements in any queries?
- How has performance improved for you with a window function
- Draw a picture of a window with a spatial function – more extra points

Give us some specifics, with real world problems. Obfuscate the data, at least if you have my name in your dev system, but help others understand how they might solve a complex aggregate using a Window function. The more specific examples, the more others might get help from one of the posts.
