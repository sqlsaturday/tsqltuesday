[Invitation](https://sqlchow.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/t-sql-tuesday-050-automation-how-much-of-it-is-the-same/) from [Hemanth D](https://sqlchow.wordpress.com/).

<div class="hfeed" id="container"><div class="clearfix" id="wrapper"><div class="grid col-620" id="content"><div class="post-430 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-sql-server tag-tsql2sday tag-automation" id="post-430"><div class="post-entry">Automation plays a huge part in our lives and the DBA profession is no so different. A couple of years ago this topic was shared by [Pat Wright](http://sqlasylum.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-15-automation-in-sql-server/). I would like to revisit this again and see how much of our approach has changed.

You could write about, what options you would consider when automating something? Where do you draw the line? What are our preferred tools for automation? T-SQL, PowerShell, VBScript or Batch files(?) or maybe just share something that you automated in the last couple of years.
