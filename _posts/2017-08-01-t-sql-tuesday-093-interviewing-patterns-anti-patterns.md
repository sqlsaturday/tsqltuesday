[Invitation](https://littlekendra.com/2017/08/01/tsql-tuesday-93-interviewing-patterns-anti-patterns/?utm_campaign=twitter&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter) and [advice from the community](https://littlekendra.com/2017/08/14/interviewing-patterns-anti-patterns-advice-from-the-sql-server-community/) from [Kendra Little](https://littlekendra.com).

What advice do you have for people preparing for or going throughn interview?

Feel free to be creative on this topic. Take whichever approach you like best:

- You may focus on patterns to follow for success
- You may list anti-patterns, too: things that might seem like a good idea, but are a recipe for disaster
- You can write about your own highs and lows as a candidate or as an interviewer
- Be as specific as you want for interviewing for or hiring for your given skillset, whether you’re a developer, DBA, manager, consultant, or something else entirely

Whichever route you take, it’s probably a good idea to disguise the identities of past employers, candidates, etc.

Personally, I’m going to take the approach of writing about an interview for a SQL Server position that I *completely bombed* as a candidate, and why it ended up being one of the best learning experiences of my life (although it was painful at the time). It taught me a lot about successful interviewing patterns.

I can’t wait to learn about YOUR interviewing patterns and anti-patterns as well.

Get ready, get set, get blogging!
