[Invitation](http://codegumbo.com/index.php/2011/09/27/tsql2sday-t-sql-tuesday-23early-edition/) and [roundup](http://codegumbo.com/index.php/2011/10/10/tsql2sday-roundup/) from [Stuart Ainsworth](http://codegumbo.com/).

Topic d’jour? **JOINS** (I’m in a fundamentals mood lately). Note that I also like creative and esoteric posts, so if you can find a way to apply SQL as a metaphorical language for community activity, I’ll read it and enjoy it. If you just want to tell me in a simple fashion the difference between a HASH and MERGE join, I’m cool with that, too.
