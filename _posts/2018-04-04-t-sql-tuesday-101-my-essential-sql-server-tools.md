[Invitation](http://t-sql.dk/?p=1947) and [roundup](http://t-sql.dk/?p=2201) from Jens Vestergaard.

## The Essential SQL Server Tools in my stack

Besides SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio Data Tools we all have our own set of tools that we use for everyday chores and tasks. But how do we get to know which tools are out there, if not for other professionals telling us about them? Does it have to a fully fledged with certification and all? Certainly not! If there’s some [github](https://github.com/) project out there, that is helping you be double as productive, let us know about it. You can even boast about something you’ve built yourself – if you think others will benefit from using it.

Basically I think, that by establishing awareness about what kinds of tools that are out there, new professionals will not have as steep a curve getting the pace up, as they would have had. But I suspect that even some veteran guys could have an “a-ha” moment from reading the summary.

Additionally, you *can* (read: should) share how you came to depend on said tool – and of course you are encouraged to give credit, where credit is due in terms of making you aware of the tool.

Another approach for this topic, is to approach it as kind of *A Day in the Life of* kind of blog post, as [has been done before](http://erinstellato.com/2012/07/tsql-tuesday-round-up/) by Erin Stellato ([b](http://erinstellato.com)|[l](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinstellato)|[t](http://www.twitter.com/erinstellato)). Writing with the specific angle to describing how your everyday is made easier by the use of your tool stack.
