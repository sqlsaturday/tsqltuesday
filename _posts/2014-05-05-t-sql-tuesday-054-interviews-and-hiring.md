[Invitation](http://borishristov.com/blog/t-sql-tuesday-54-interview-invitation/) and [summary ](http://borishristov.com/blog/t-sql-tuesday-54-interview-invitation-summary/)from [Boris Hristov](http://borishristov.com/).

<div class="site-container"><div class="site-inner"><div class="content-sidebar-wrap"><article class="post-4555 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-sqlserver tag-human-resources tag-job-interviews tag-recruting tag-tsql2sday entry"><div class="entry-content">My idea here is to hear from you anything related to interviews and hiring SQL Server professionals. That could be any of those below:

1. The story of how did you get hired on your latest position?
2. The most interesting interview you ever had?
3. How do you think an interview should be handled? What should it include?
4. Any “algorithms” of how to find the perfect candidate?
5. If you are the one that leads the technical interview – what do you focus on?
6. What are the most important questions to ask for the various SQL Server positions out there?
7. Any combinations of those above?
8. Anything else you’d love to share…
