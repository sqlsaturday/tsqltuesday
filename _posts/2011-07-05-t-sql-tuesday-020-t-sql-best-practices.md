[Invitation](https://troubleshootingsql.com/2011/07/05/invitation-for-t-sql-tuesday-19-t-sql-best-practices/) and [summary](https://troubleshootingsql.com/2011/07/15/) from [Amit Banerjee.](https://troubleshootingsql.com/)

## What is the topic for July?

The topic for July is “**T-SQL Best Practices**”. If you work with SQL Server, then undoubtedly you would have had to write T-SQL queries atleast once or would have had to debug the seemingly useful piece of T-SQL code written by your developers to find out where the performance bottleneck or problem was. Your post for this month’s revolving blog party could be along one of the areas:

a. A set of T-SQL best practices that you follow in your shop that or you believe that should be followed always. It could be as specific as for writing only linked server queries or writing queries for SSIS packages etc.  
b. An issue that you resolved because certain T-SQL best practices were not followed.  
c. A workaround that you used (like query hints) to resolve an issue where T-SQL best practices couldn’t be implemented due to involvement of a third party solution.

## Why did I choose this topic?

Over the years of troubleshooting SQL performance related issues, I have found on multiple occasions that the T-SQL query in question was performing badly because certain best practices for writing that piece of code were not followed and the one responsible for the development had not foreseen that such an oversight could become a bottleneck when the data or the number of users increased. So, I thought it would be a good idea to get the SQL Community’s thoughts around best practices in this area. *Sometimes, the most obvious things are the easiest to overlook!*
