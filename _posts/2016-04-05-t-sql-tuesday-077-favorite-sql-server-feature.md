[Invitation ](http://t-sql.dk/?p=1492)and [roundup ](http://t-sql.dk/?p=1584)from [Jens Vestergaard](http://t-sql.dk/?author=1).

This month I get to pick the topic, and I am going to go with:

> My favorite SQL Server Feature

This can be anything from Reporting Services as a report creating tool, down to the Columnstore Indexes. Anything goes!  
I selected this topic precisely to illustrate the breadth and depth of what SQL Server has evolved into over the last decade+. Starting out as a RDBMS (w/ DTS), adding Analysis Services, then Reporting Services, following a myriad of auxiliary services and tools. So please, share your story about a specific SQL Server feature close to your heart. So please, share precisely what you think makes SQL Server such an awesome tool.
