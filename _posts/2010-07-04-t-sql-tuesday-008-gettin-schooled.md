[Invitation](http://sqlsoldier.net/wp/sqlserver/t-sql-tuesday-008-gettin-schooled) and [roundup ](http://sqlsoldier.net/wp/sqlserver/tsqltuesday8roundup)from [Robert Davis](http://www.sqlsoldier.com/wp/).

This month’s topic will be all about learning and teaching.

We return to our days of youth to take a fresh look at learning. How do you learn? How do you teach? What are you learning or teaching? Or the coup de grace post would be learning something new and telling us about it.
