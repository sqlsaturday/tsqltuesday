[Invitation](https://erikdarlingdata.com/t-sql-tuesday-code-that-made-you-feel-a-way/) and [roundup](https://erikdarlingdata.com/t-sql-tuesday-164-the-feelings-roundup-tsqltuesday/) from Erik Darling.

This month’s topic challenges you to think back to the last time you saw code that made you feel a thing. Hopefully a positive thing.

I’m not a thesaurus, so the list isn’t exhaustive, but think along the lines of: surprise, awe, inspiration, excitement.

Or maybe it was just code that sort of sunk its teeth into you and made you want to learn a whole lot more.

This won’t be my submission, but I think a great example is a piece of query tuning magic by Paul White. It was one of the first articles I ever read as a young SQL Developer.

- [Optimising Server-Side Paging – Part I](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/optimising-server-side-paging-part-i)
- [Optimising Server-Side Paging – Part II](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/optimising-server-side-paging-part-ii)

It was one of many lightbulb moments (and, crap, I should have said lightbulb moment up there when I was telling you what kind of code I want you to think about) that I’ve had in my career.

The only rule I have is (outside of the [normal T-SQL Tuesday rules](http://tsqltuesday.com/rules/)) is that it can’t be your own code.

It should also probably be code that you won’t get sued for showing or talking about. Please be diligent in abiding by copyrights.

Other than that, it’s the normal pack of rabbits: submissions have to be posted next Tuesday, the 11th of July.
