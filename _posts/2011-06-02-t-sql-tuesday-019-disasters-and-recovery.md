[Invitation](http://www.allenkinsel.com/archive/2011/06/invitation-for-t-sql-tuesday-19-disasters-recovery/) and [wrapup](http://www.allenkinsel.com/archive/2011/06/t-sql-tuesday-19-wrapup/) from [Allen Kinsel](http://www.allenkinsel.com/).

# Disasters

Its the first week of June and for those of us living along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the US, that brings the beginning of [hurricane season](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Atlantic_hurricane_season). It also means its time for this months installment of T-SQL Tuesday.

## This Months Topic

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_902">[![Hurricane Ike dead ahead](http://www.allenkinsel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0010-300x225.jpg "Hurricane Ike dead ahead")](http://www.allenkinsel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0010.jpg)There goes your weekend/month

</div>Disaster Recovery. This topic is very near and dear to me based on the fact that I live on a barrier island that was the site to the [deadliest natural disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane) in US history and more recently destroyed by the [third costliest hurricane ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Ike)in history. Needless to say preparing for disasters is nearly instinctive to me which might explain why I’m a DBA but I digress. Anything you’d like to blog about related to preparing for or recovering from a disaster would be fair game, have a great tip you use to keep backups and recovers running smoothly, a horrific story of recovery gone wrong? or anything else related to keeping your systems online during calamity. We want to hear it!
