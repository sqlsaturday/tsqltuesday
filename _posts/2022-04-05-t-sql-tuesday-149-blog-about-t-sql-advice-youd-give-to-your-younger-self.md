[Invitation](https://camilahenrique.com/2022/04/05/tsql2sday-149-invitation-blog-about-t-sql-advice-youd-give-to-your-younger-self/) and [round up](https://camilahenrique.com/2022/04/14/t-sql-tuesday-round-up-lets-check-our-contributions/) from [Camila Henrique](https://camilahenrique.com/).

[T-SQL Tuesday](http://tsqltuesday.com/) is a monthly blogothon where a host chooses one topic and bloggers around the world give their ideas about it. This month is my first time being the host and I’m so excited!

April’s theme: **if you could give advice about T-SQL to your younger self, what would you say?** I’m not defining any more specific sub-topics here, I’m opening the floor to hear ideas about your past experiences and what you wish you knew better back then.
