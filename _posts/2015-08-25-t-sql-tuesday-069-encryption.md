[Invitation ](http://sqlbama.com/archive/2015/08/t-sql-tuesday-69-encryption/)and [roundup](http://sqlbama.com/archive/2015/08/t-sql-tuesday-69-round-up/) from [Ken Wilson](http://sqlbama.com/).

This month I am honored to be your host, and the topic is encryption. There are so many options to encrypt data in SQL Server, and yet, it is often a feature that is left unused. If you are struggling for ideas to write about, consider a few questions to get started. How are you encrypting your data? Why did you choose that option over another? What were some of the performance impacts or issues you encountered along the way?

Not using encryption? That’s okay; you can still participate. Write about the obstacles that are preventing you from implementing encryption in your environment, or to steal a quote from Adam’s [first T-SQL Tuesday post](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/archive/2009/11/30/invitation-to-participate-in-t-sql-tuesday-001-date-time-tricks.aspx), “any post that is related to both SQL Server and the theme is fair game. So feel free to post about SSIS, SSRS, Java integration, or whatever other technologies you’re working with in conjunction with SQL Server.”
