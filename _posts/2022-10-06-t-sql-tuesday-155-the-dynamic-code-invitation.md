[Invitation ](https://voiceofthedba.com/2022/10/06/t-sql-tuesday-155-the-dynamic-code-invitation/)from [Steve Jones](https://voiceofthedba.com/).

I saw a post recently where someone noted they used Excel to help build dynamic SQL for their job. I thought that was a) creative, and b) similar to something Iâ€™ve done. In fact, that will be my post for this month.

However, while many of the experts decry dynamic SQL as a poor way of solving problems, it is not going away. In fact, it works really well for many situations and problems, albeit not necessarily a high volumes of data. There also are security concerns.

My invitation this month is to write about producing SQL dynamically in some way. Let us know about any of these things:

- a problem you solved
- a creative use of technology to build SQL
- security concerns
- a place where dynamic SQL failed you
- a way to convert dynamic SQL to something cleaner
- anything else that relates to code producing code
