[Invitation ](https://wendyverse.blogspot.com/2016/04/its-time-for-t-sql-tuesday-78-may-2016.html) from [Wendy Pastrick](https://wendyverse.blogspot.com/).

Plenty of heads-up for this installment of #tsql2sday because this time, I’m challenging you to learn something new and blog about it!

There are so many new things to play around with, some brand-spanking newly released, and others that have been around for a bit, but you’ve probably still not taken any time to try it out.

Here’s a short list of ideas to get you started:

- PowerBI
- Azure (remember you can get $150 monthly credit just for trying it out!) 
    - Virtual Machines
    - SQL Database
    - Stretch tables
- SQL Server on Linux
- SQL 2016 
    - Always Encrypted
- Query Store

- Row Level Security
