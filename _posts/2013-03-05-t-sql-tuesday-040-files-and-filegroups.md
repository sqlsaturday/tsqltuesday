<div class="hfeed site" id="page"><div class="site-main" id="main"><div class="content-area" id="primary"><div class="site-content" id="content"><article class="post-3847 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-community category-sql-server category-sqlserverpedia-syndication category-ssc category-tech-and-learning category-tips" id="post-3847"><div class="entry-content">Hold on! I already hear some of you shouting, “Boooooring!!!” You don’t have to write a file and filegroup primer, if you don’t want to. Get creative, get tangential! Some of my suggestions:

- Maybe you’d like to talk about partitioning indexes or tables across filegroups
- Or performance benefits (still!) of assigning tables to specific drives, via filegroups
- Or FILESTREAM, specifically (hey, that’s something that requires a specialized filegroup!)
- Or some horrible misuse of filegroups you’ve seen once (we always love a SQL horror story)
- Or, if you have a mind, a file and filegroup backup/restore primer! (Why not? I’m not the only one who loves basics.)
