[Invitation ](http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2013/03/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-040-file-and-filegroup-wisdom/)and [roundup](http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2013/03/t-sql-tuesday-40-roundup-files-and-filegroups/) from [Jen McCown](http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/author/jen/).

Hold on! I already hear some of you shouting, “Boooooring!!!” You don’t have to write a file and filegroup primer, if you don’t want to. Get creative, get tangential! Some of my suggestions:

- Maybe you’d like to talk about partitioning indexes or tables across filegroups
- Or performance benefits (still!) of assigning tables to specific drives, via filegroups
- Or FILESTREAM, specifically (hey, that’s something that requires a specialized filegroup!)
- Or some horrible misuse of filegroups you’ve seen once (we always love a SQL horror story)
- Or, if you have a mind, a file and filegroup backup/restore primer! (Why not? I’m not the only one who loves basics.)

So talk to us, tell us all of your file and filegroup lore!
