This month’s T-SQL Tuesday invitation:
- You can talk about whatever you want, but it has to be a video
- Non-video entries will not be televised
- You don’t have to be on camera
- You can host the video anywhere you want
- You must link back to this post so I get a pingback to find your post
- You must include the T-SQL Tuesday Logo
