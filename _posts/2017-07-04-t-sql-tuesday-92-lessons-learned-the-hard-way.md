Current [Invitation](http://www.sqldoubleg.com/2017/07/03/tsql2sday-92-lessons-learned-the-hard-way/) and [roundup](http://www.sqldoubleg.com/2017/07/31/t-sql-tuesday-92-lessons-learned-the-hard-way-wrapping-up/) from [Raul Gonzalez](http://www.sqldoubleg.com).

For this month, I want you peers to write about those important lessons that you learned the hard way, for instance something you did and put your systems down or maybe something you didn’t do and took your systems down. It can be also a bad decision you or someone else took back in the day and you’re still paying for it…

There are so many things to share here so everybody can learn from each others mistakes, because all of us were once a beginner and no one is born with any knowledge about SQL Server.

Please do not be ashamed of sharing your experiences, you can anonymize the whole story if you want but remember all people make mistakes, the important is to learn from them and try not to repeat them in the future.
