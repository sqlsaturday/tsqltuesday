SQL Server as a product is maturing with every new version since its inception and getting better and better over the years. But there seems to be lot of misunderstanding of some SQL Server concepts in the community and probably in my opinion its because of one or more items listed below.

1\. While some information holds true in previous versions but they don’t hold true in newer versions (after some components were re-written, optimized).  
2\. Bugs in older versions are fixed in newer versions.  
3\. Taking the words out of context from someone’s publication/blogs etc…  
4\. Someone simply misunderstood the concepts.  
5\. Never realized the depth of the internals or the scope of the subject.  
6\. Taking marketing fluff as truth.  
7\. Too much generalization of the facts based on one or two incidents.

The possibilities for writing up a post on this topic invloving SQL Server are enormous even if you are a novice blogger or the industry expert on SQL Server. So get ready with your \[misconceptions, myth-busters, de-mystifiers, do you know, back to basics, fact checking\] posts on SQL Server and help the community learn more stuff while setting the facts straight.

I want to take a moment and request if you are working on a misconception that was already busted by someone else in the community and your approach is also very similar then please give credit to the person that did the work prior to you in your post.
