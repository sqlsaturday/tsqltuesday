[Invitation ](http://mickeystuewe.com/2015/11/03/t-sql-tuesday-72-invitation-data-modeling-gone-wrong/)and [roundup ](http://mickeystuewe.com/2015/11/16/t-sql-tuesday-72-summarydata-modeling-gone-wrong/)from [Mickey Stuewe](http://mickeystuewe.com/).

The purpose of SQL Server, is to make sure that the databases are kept safe and run as optimally as possible. The problem is, if the data model is flawed, or not maintained, then no matter how optimally the SQL Server is configured, the database wonâ€™t be able to function efficiently.

I would like to invite you to share some data modeling practices that should be avoided, and how to fix them when they do occur.
