[Invitation](https://voiceofthedba.com/2025/11/07/t-sql-tuesday-192-invitation-sql-server-2025-excitement/) from [Steve Jones](https://voiceofthedba.com/)

## SQL Server 2025 Excitement

It’s that time of the month again, and once again, I’m late and I’m hosting. I was traveling a lot in October and didn’t sort out hosting for this month. I have someone for Dec, and am looking for more in 2026. This will be a focus for me in December this.

My apologies, and I’ll try to do better.

Without further ago, …

## The Invitation

Next week many of us are expecting to see SQL Server 2025 released to the public. The RC0 has been out for awhile and slowly we see people testing it. Even [Brent has a server being monitored](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2025/10/sql-constantcare-population-report-fall-2025/) that's a 2025 instance. Between Ignite and the PASS Data Community Summit, it has to release then, right?

We’ll see.

In any case, there are [some interesting changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2025?view=sql-server-ver17&preserve-view=true), including some language changes. While SQL Server is a mature product, and you might not be that excited, I’m wondering if there is anything that you’re looking forward to working on?

I’ve got a few ideas, but let me know what things in SQL Server will make your job easier, please your customers/clients, or maybe generate a little excitement in your life.

A few topics:
- AI capabilities being added to SQL Server
- Change Event Streaming
- RegEx
- JSON enhancements
- Batch Mode improvements
- AG enhancements
- Security changes for managed identities
- Password policy on Linux
- ADR in tempdb

There’s plenty more, so start writing and publish next week, Nov 11.
