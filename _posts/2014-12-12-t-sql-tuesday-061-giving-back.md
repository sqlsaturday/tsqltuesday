<div class="pageContainer"><div class="contentWrapper RS"><div class="contentArea" id="contentArea"><div class="post post-2217 type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-tsql-tuesday" id="post-2217"><div class="postContent">In “The Spirit of Giving”, I want to know how you plan on Giving Back to the SQL Community during the coming year. Are you going to start speaking at your local user group? Speak at your local SQL Saturday? Perhaps step up and help run your local user group? Do you want to start becoming an active blogger – or increase your blogging? Do you plan on volunteering your time with larger organizations (such as PASS), so that SQL Training can occur at a larger level? However you plan on giving back to the SQL Community during the upcoming year, and whether it is something new that you’ll be doing or continuing what you are doing, I’m looking forward to reading about it in your blog post.
