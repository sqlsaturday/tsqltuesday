My first exposure to [Rube Goldberg Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) was playing the game [Mouse Trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Trap_(game)) as a child. I work almost exclusively on the SQL development side of the house, where we sometimes build crazy creative solutions to solve business problems. We generally know the ‘right’ way to do things, but pesky issue like budgets, personnel, and deadlines get in the way. So, we channel our inner [MacGyver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver), grab a handful paper clips and some duct tape, and then do things with SQL Server that we know shouldn’t be done (in an ideal world). And we hope nobody ever finds out how we bent the rules, because we know they will judge us (as we would judge them) and call our work a &lt;gasp&gt;HACK&lt;/gasp&gt;.

So, if you would please, dust off one of those skeletons and tell us how you got really creative with SQL Server, instead of doing it ‘the right way’. In other words, tell us about your ugly SQL baby. If you’re worried about saving face, feel free to describe how you would have implemented the solution if you lived in that ideal world.
