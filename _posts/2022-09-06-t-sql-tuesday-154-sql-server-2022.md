[Invitation](https://glennsqlperformance.com/2022/09/05/t-sql-tuesday-154-invitation-sql-server-2022/) from [Glenn Berry](https://glennsqlperformance.com/).

Your mission, ***if you choose to accept it***, is to write about what you have been doing (if anything) with SQL Server 2022. Maybe you have been doing a lot of testing with the public CTP builds and now RC0. Perhaps you have not had the time (or interest) in doing any SQL Server 2022 testing or research. Whatever you have been doing, now is your chance to talk about it, good or bad.

Maybe you can’t wait for SQL Server 2022 to be released, or perhaps you couldn’t care less about it. I would love to hear what your experience has been and what your opinions are about this release. If SQL Server 2022 is not on your future roadmap, please tell me why.

Just in case you haven’t heard much about SQL Server 2022, here are a few links from Microsoft.
