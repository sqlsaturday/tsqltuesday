[Invitation](https://devjef.wordpress.com/2016/09/06/invitation-t-sql-tuesday-82-to-the-cloud-and-beyond/) from [Jeffrey Verheul](https://devjef.wordpress.com/).

When Adam asked me if I wanted to host another T-SQL Tuesday, I immediately knew a topic I wanted to talk about: The cloud, and (if you want to) specifically about Azure SQL database.

Last time we blogged about the cloud was back in december of 2013, when [Jorge Segarra](http://www.sqlchicken.com/2013/11/t-sql-tuesday-48-cloud-atlas/) hosted this monthly party. Since then, “the cloud” (to use that buzz-word again) has changed a lot, and I think the possibilities are endless nowadays.

The reason I would like to see you all blog about this topic, is that I’m working with Azure SQL databases a lot now since I switched jobs in December. Currently I’m working for a small start-up that has a cloud-first focus. This means the main (if possible) host for our (data)platform is Azure. And although hosting our platform in Azure makes it easier for us to scale parts of that platform, it also gives us new challenges to overcome. And I’m probably not the only one with that experience…

So with that said, I would like to give you the opportunity to blog about the cloud, in the broadest sense that you can imagine. I’m imagining really interesting blogs about migrating to the cloud, [missing features in Azure SQL database](http://www.coeo.com/blog/gavinpayne/2016/02/03/one-of-our-agents-is-missing/), [how you’re determining the cause of and solving performance problems](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/archive/2016/04/14/sp-whoisactive-for-azure-sql-database-attempt-2.aspx), etc. Please surprise us all with your view on the cloud.
