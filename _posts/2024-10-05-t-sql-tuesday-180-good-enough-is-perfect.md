[Invitation ](https://sqlkitty.com/t-sql-tues-good-perfect/) from [Josephine Bush](https://sqlkitty.com/)

How can you achieve good enough without compromising the process/product? In the world of database technology, striving for perfection is a double-edged sword. While high standards are important for maintaining reliable, efficient systems, trying for absolute perfection can quickly lead to back-breaking workloads and burnout. It’s equally important to recognize that “good enough is perfect.” This doesn’t mean settling for mediocrity but focusing on realistic goals that get results without burning yourself out.

To me, trying to be perfect is:
- Working long hours regularly: Sometimes, extra work is necessary, but that should be the exception, not the rule.
- Overcommitting to Meetings: Attending every meeting to stay in the loop drains time and focus. Prioritize only those essential to your role.
- Doing It All Yourself: Refusing to delegate because you want things done a specific way limits productivity and can lead to burnout.
- Perfectionist Deadlines: Setting impossibly tight deadlines to “go above and beyond” often leads to rushed work and fatigue. Aim for realistic timelines.
- Avoiding Breaks: Skipping lunch or breaks to “stay productive” reduces long-term effectiveness. Breaks are vital for focus and performance.
- Saying Yes to Every Request: Agreeing to every task to appear helpful spreads you thin. Be selective to focus on high-priority work.
- Striving to Be Available 24/7: Responding to emails or messages at all hours can feel like dedication but risks burnout. Set clear boundaries for work time and personal time.

How do you get to good enough and not burn yourself out with perfect?
