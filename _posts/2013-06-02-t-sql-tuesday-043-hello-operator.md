[Invitation](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2013/06/02/t-sql-tuesday-43-hello-operator.aspx) and [roundup ](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/robfarley/~3/7aacI-8ilWU/plan-operator-tuesday-round-up.aspx)from [Rob Farley](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/).

The topic is **[Plan Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191158.aspx)**. If you ever write T-SQL, you will almost certainly have looked at execution plans (if you haven’t, go look at some now. I mean really – you should be looking at this stuff). As you look at these things, you will almost certainly have had your interest piqued by some, and tried to figure out a bit more about what’s going on.

That’s what I want you to write about! One (or more) plan operators that you looked into. It could be a particular aspect of a plan operator, or you could do a deep dive and tell us everything you know. You could relate a tuning story if you want, or it could be completely academic. Don’t just quote Books Online at me, explain what the operator means to you. You could explore the [Compute Scalar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178082(v=sql.105).aspx) operator, or the many-to-many feature of a [Merge Join](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189961(v=sql.105).aspx). The [Sequence Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187041(v=sql.105).aspx), or the [Lazy Spool](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191221(v=sql.105).aspx). You’re bound to have researched one of them at some point (if you never have, take the opportunity this week), and have some wisdom to impart. This is a chance to raise the collective understanding about execution plans!
