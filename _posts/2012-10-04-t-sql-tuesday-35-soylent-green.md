[Invitation ](http://blog.nhaslam.com/2012/10/04/t-sql-tuesday-35-soylent-green-tsql2sday/)and [Roundup ](http://blog.nhaslam.com/2012/10/16/soylent-green-the-aftermath-tsql2sday/)from [Nick Haslam](https://blog.nhaslam.com/)

Over the past couple of days I’ve been attending a training course in Paris, and one evening, to relax I watched ‘[Soylent Green](http://www.imdb.com/rg/action-box-title/primary-photo/media/rm3498286848/tt0070723)‘, a classic science fiction film. If you’ve not seen it, I recommend it, and go and watch it …

So, what I’d like to know is, what is your most horrifying discovery from your work with SQL Server?

We all like to read stories of other people’s misfortunes and, in some ways they help to make us better people by learning from them. Hopefully, there is nothing as bad as Charlton Heston’s discovery, but there may be in its own way.

**A couple of extra thoughts for motivational thinking…**

*Soylent Brown* – You did a post, Great Job!!

*Soylent Orange* – You did a post, it made me wince!

*Soylent Green* – You did a post, it made me wince, and it included some T-SQL.
