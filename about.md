T-SQL Tuesday is the brainchild of Adam Machanic. It is a monthly blog party on the second Tuesday of each month. Everyone is welcome to participate and I’d encourage you to write on these topics, whether you do so on that particular month or not.

This sites hosts the list of all the topics. I was looking for a static list of all the T-SQL Tuesday topics and couldn’t find one. The domain moves around to the current hosting blog, so when it was my turn to host it, I made a list just so I could reference what was out there. After a few more months, I decided to update my list with the latest topics.

Eventually Adam asked me to host the site, and here it is.
