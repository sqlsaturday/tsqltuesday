    <p>SQL Saturday Oregon is a free one day training event for Data Professionals interested in the Microsoft Data Platform. Topics covered include: SQL Server, Power BI, Azure Synapse, Data Visualization, DataVerse, and much more!</p>
    <p>Registration, which is FREE, will be required due to capacity limitations. Coffee, Beverages, and Lunch will be provided. The venue is located in beautiful downtown Vancouver, Washington (USA – the FIRST Vancouver!), close to restaurants and shopping!</p>
    <p>SQL Saturday Oregon will start off with coffee service and registration.  We will have a mid-morning and afternoon break for our wonderful sponsors to speak on stage about their products.  At our catered lunch, our two Marquee Sponsors, OmniData and VirtueTech will be speaking one at a time on the main stage.  Finally, before our raffle (you have to be there to win!), we will be treated to a special keynote speaker, Kellyn Gorman, Director of Technical Advocacy at Silk.  She will be presenting on “Adapting and Thriving: Navigating the Intersections of AI, Machine Learning, and Economic Challenges as a Technical Specialist”. The event will end with a raffle of gifts provided by our many wonderful Sponsors. Come join the Data Community Family and meet fellow data professionals, employers, vendors, and experts on November 11th!</p>

    <p>For those interested, this is the weekend before the <a href="https://www.passdatacommunitysummit.com/">Pass Data Community Summit</a> and the SQL Train will be running from Portland to Seattle.

sponsorplan:
    <h1><a name="sponsorship">Sponsorship Plan</a></h1>
    <p>SQL Saturday Oregon and SW Washington will be held on the campus of Clark College on November 11th, 2023. This year we plan to deliver five tracks with each having six one hour presentations and a final end of day gathering for giving away prizes. Our normal attendance is in the range of 400 +</p>
    <p>In order to remove some of the issues with the classic “lunchtime” vendor sessions, we are going to have all vendor presentations on the main stage.  There will be a morning session and an afternoon session scheduled during the coffee breaks that are part of the schedule.  Our hope is that our valued vendors will have a much greater attendance for their short session on the main stage.</p>
    <h2>Sponsorship Levels</h2>
    <p>All sponsors will be listed on our SQL Saturday event page and announced to attendees during the event. All sponsorship fees must be paid in advance of the event. Attendees receive a sponsor passport listing the sponsors at Brand Builder or higher level.  We encourage sponsors to bring one or more prizes valued at least $100 and display it prominently at your table. If you want to discuss an option or idea not listed below, please contact us, we will do our best to work with you!</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Marquee Exhibitor ($1500)</b>. Want to have your voice heard?  Only the Marquee Exhibitor will be doing a full presentation at lunchtime on the main stage.  Their presentation is expected to start 15 – 20 minutes after the lunch service starts.  The Marquee Exhibitor will also have a table and chairs in the main hall. <b>SOLD OUT</b></li>
      <li><b>Exhibitor ($1000)</b>. The ideal sponsor level for those that want to be on site to interact with our attendees.

      <li><b>Brand Builder ($500)</b>. For sponsors who are not able to attend in person but want to support our event and build brand awareness.
