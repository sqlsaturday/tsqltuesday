  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>We appreciate your support of free technical training and are excited to provide a variety of opportunities to take part in SQL Saturday NYC by sponsoring our event.</p>
  <h2>Event Overview</h2>
  <p>SQL Saturday is a one-day conference packed with some of best speakers available in the field and hundreds of motivated attendees, all of which are ready to make this an excellent learning opportunity for all involved.  Our speakers travel from all over the country (and beyond) to share their knowledge and improve the SQL Server community as a whole.</p>
  <p>Breakfast and lunch are provided on-site as a way to promote networking between the attendees, speakers, and sponsors.  A dedicated area is available for the sponsors so that attendees will have the opportunity to meet with them throughout the day.</p>
  <p>SQL Saturday NYC will have an extensive schedule of sessions on a wide variety of technical and professional development topics.  Session levels will range from beginner to advanced/expert with enough variety to ensure that attendees at any stage of their career can benefit from multiple available tracks.</p>

Payment/confirmation of these opportunities will be managed separately from the Sponsorship Eventbrite page.  Please <a href="./#contact">contact the event organizers</a> to inquire further.</p>

  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>All fees must be paid in advance. To register as a sponsor, please visit the SQL Saturday New York City Sponsorship Eventbrite page here: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sql-saturday-new-york-city-sponsorship-tickets-519707518177">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sql-saturday-new-york-city-sponsorship-tickets-519707518177</a>.
  <p>To pay via other methods, such as check, wire transfer, or Paypal, please contact Edward Pollack at ed@edwardpollack.com. We will send you an invoice that can be paid via another payment method.</p>
  <h3>The Raffle â€“ Your Key to Success!</h3>
  <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow-ups. Few attendees will have business cards and most will not provide their personal information without some amount of prompting or motivation.  Hosting a raffle is an inexpensive and effective way to increase interaction with attendees, make their experience more exciting, and collect attendee information.</p>
  <p>Due to privacy and compliance regulations, our conference organizers cannot share the personal information of attendees with you.  Therefore, raffles or similar interactions are the only way to collect leads from this event.</p>
  <p>Because we want you to be successful, all sponsorship levels include the requirement of a raffle prize.  We recommend advertising the raffle prize prior to SQL Saturday NYC by email, social media, or at other events. The raffle can also be marketed at SQL Saturday NYC at sponsor tables, during sponsor-driven sessions, or via word-of-mouth. </p>
  <p>If a member of your team is present at the event, they may provide a brief introduction at the closing ceremony and select the raffle winner(s).  Otherwise, we can assist as needed to ensure that the raffle prize is given away and any follow-up tasks are handled for you. </p>
  <p>After the event we will mail you all the raffle tickets from your box so you can follow up with attendees that stopped by your table during the event.</p>
  <h3>Event Logistics</h3>
  <p>Weâ€™ll open the doors to sponsors at 7:00am EST. Sponsors will be provided with a table, chairs, and limited access to power.  Please let us know what you need in advance, and we will do everything we can to accommodate your needs. Sponsor tables will be centrally located in the same area as registration, breakfast, and lunch to make it easy for attendees to stop by at any time during the day. We encourage sponsors to remain on site throughout the event and, if possible, to have a representative present at the end of the day to personally present your prize when the raffle winners are announced.  We understand if this is not possible and will assist with logistics in the event that you are unable to remain at the event for the duration of the day.</p>
  <p>Lunch will be provided to sponsors that have registered. Registration will open up for SQL Saturday New York City closer to the event date.  We will contact you then and ensure that any members of your staff that will be on-site can register.</p>
  <h3>Contact Us</h3>
  <p>We hope you will support this event! Feel free to direct any questions, comments, or suggestions to Ed Pollack, <A href="mailto:ed@edwardpollack.com">ed@edwardpollack.com</a>.</p>
