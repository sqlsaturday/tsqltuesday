    <h1><a name="sponsorship">Sponsorship Plan</a></h1>
    <p>SQL Saturday Denver 2022 will be held on the campus of Cherry Creek Presbyterian Church September 17th, 2022. This year we plan to deliver five tracks with each having five one hour presentations, plus three sponsor presentations at lunch and a final end of day gathering for giving away prizes. Our pre-pandemic attendance was in the range of 250-300, but based on other, more recent, events we are forecasting 125-150 attendees at this year’s event.</p>
    <h2>Sponsorship Levels</h2>
    <p>All sponsors will be listed on our SQLSaturday event page and announced to attendees during the event. All sponsorship fees must be paid in advance of the event. Attendees receive a raffle ticket for each sponsor at the Silver or higher level. We encourage sponsors to bring one or more prizes valued at $100 or more and display these prominently at your table. Raffle tickets will have a QR code that contains attendee info and we recommend purchasing a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D799ZDD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">2D compatible scanner</a> as they are much faster than using a phone. If you want to discuss an option or idea not listed below, please contact us, we will do our best to work with you!</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Cairn ($250)</b>. Leave your Mark! For companies who want to support our event or engage in brand building. We’ll include your logo on our event pages and let all our attendees know how much we appreciate your support! <a href="https://py.pl/JzVI8">Sign up to be a Cairn Sponsor</a>!</li>
      <li><b>Crest ($750)</b>. Make an impact even if you can’t attend. For Sponsors who are not able to attend in person but want to support our event and build brand awareness. We will set up a raffle box for you if you provide a prize (gift cards are easy, but it’s up to you!) and will forward you the scans of the tickets via email after the event. <a href="https://py.pl/19sR1u">Sign up to be a Crest Sponsor</a>!</li>
      <li><b>Summit ($1250)</b>. Reach for the top! The ideal Sponsor level for those that want to maximize interaction with attendees and promote brand awareness. Includes all Crest Sponsorship benefits as well as a table and two chairs in the Exhibitor area. <a href="https://py.pl/26JUMc">Sign up to be a Summit Sponsor</a>!</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>How many attendees are expected?</h3>
    <p>Given that this is the first in person SQL Saturday in a couple of years we’re not entirely sure of attendance – it’s possible we’ll see some reluctance to attend large public events but we’re hearing a lot of pent-up interest in the other direction.  The event center has a published capacity limit of 120 but wouldn’t be surprised if we exceed that limit a bit.</p>
    <h3>Is there a specific theme or hot topics for presentation submissions?</h3>
    <p>We’re hoping to have 3-4 learning tracks, though speaker submissions will define groupings, likely including these topics among others: BI/Data Analytics, Performance Tuning, AI/ML, All things Azure, Power BI, etc.  Attendees tend to have a wide range of interests so we try to cast as big a net as possible in terms of topics.</p>
