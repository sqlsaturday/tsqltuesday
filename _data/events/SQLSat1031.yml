    <h1><a name="sponsorship">Sponsorship Plan</a></h1>
    <p>You can download a <a href="/assets/doc/Boston_2022-SQL_Saturday_Sponsorship_Plan.docx">Word document of the sponsorship plan</a>.</p>
    <p>Boston SQLSaturday is a one-day conference hosted by NESQL, a 501(c)7 non-profit organization.  Our event, which has been running for over 10 years, features volunteer speakers who present topics related to the Microsoft Data Platform.  With the support of sponsors like you, this event has and continues to remain free and open to the public, attracting 300 attendees every year, all of whom would love to meet you!</p>
    <h2>The Raffle – Your Key to Success!</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow ups. We will provide attendees with a set of pre-printed raffle tickets (see below) that will contain their name and email address. They will then opt-in by putting their tickets into vendor raffle boxes at each sponsor table to try to win a prize. </p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful all of our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $100 in value.  We strongly suggest that you provide a full color 8-1/2 x 11 flyer that highlights the prize(s) you are raffling off.</p>
    <p>We will provide each vendor a raffle box and will have one table for all absentee vendors placed in the same areas with our onsite vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day, when the raffle draw will be done during closing ceremonies. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a physical prize we’ll give it to them, otherwise we’ll forward you their contact information for you to follow up with (for license keys, etc.).  After the event, you may take all of your collected raffle tickets. </p>
    <h2>Sponsorship Levels</h2>
    <p>These are the sponsorship levels. Please <a href="/assets/doc/Boston_2022-SQL_Saturday_Sponsorship_Plan.docx">download the document</a> for more details.</p>
