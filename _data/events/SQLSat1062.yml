    <p>We are looking forward to bringing SQL Saturday in Dhaka,Bangladesh back from Virtual to In-Person! We listened to feedback from the last year and know that now is the time and that the community is ready to come back out to in-person for a full day of community learning and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Global growth and adopting innovation are obviously a key area where we should be concentrating on. SQL Saturday is an ideal mechanism for organically growing memberships in both established and unestablished areas of the globe, and tighter integration with the global growth plans should be a priority.</p>
    <p>SQL Saturday is a free training event for SQL Server professionals and those wanting to learn about current trend of cloud-based data management and AI-ML.This event is voluntarily organized by techforum technical community. </p>
    <p>This event will feature sessions in Microsoft Data platform i.e., AI-ML, BI, Analytics, Performance Tuning and Big Data among others.</p>

  <p>SQL Saturday Bangladesh will be held on the Microsoft Office on August 19th, 2023. This year we plan to deliver four tracks has 2 hours of presentations and an end of day gathering for giving away prizes. </p>
  <p>In order to remove some of the issues with the classic “lunchtime” vendor sessions, we are going to have all vendor presentations on the main stage. There will be a morning session and an afternoon session scheduled during the coffee breaks that are part of the schedule. Our hope is that our valued vendors will have a much greater attendance for their short session on the main stage.</p>
  <h2>Sponsorship Levels</h2>
  <p>All sponsors will be listed on our SQL Saturday event page and announced to attendees during the event. All sponsorship fees must be paid in advance of the event. Attendees receive a sponsor passport listing the sponsors at Brand Builder or higher level. </p>
