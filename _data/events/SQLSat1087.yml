    <p>SQL Saturday Minnesota 2024 #1087 is an entire day conference related to the SQL Server and data technology. SQL Saturday is organized by the PASS MN User Group, a 501c6 professional association non-profit organization.</p>
    <p>With the help of a lot of Volunteers, we provide excellent sessions, refreshments, and lunch giving ample opportunities to interact with local professionals. We work hard to ensure that the SQLSaturday is an excellent experience for all, especially our Sponsors, without whom the event would not happen. </p>
    <p>This is our 1st in-person SQL Saturday event since 2019. SQL Saturday Minnesota used to proudly boast one of the largest and broadest events in the country and in 2023 we are looking to rebuild those heights. With the support of our Sponsors, it remains free and open to the public. We anticipate hitting the ground running and hope for a return of attendance for SQLSaturday comparable to previous years. The volunteer organizers of SQL Saturday Minnesota 2024 are proud to offer the following Sponsorship opportunities.</p>
    <p>These are several ways to show your support of SQL Saturday Minnesota 2024 and achieve maximum visibility for your company. Find details about these premium Marquee Sponsorship Opportunities below.</p>
    <p>SQL Saturday Minnesota 2024 sponsorships can be paid through PayPal to the passmn@outlook.com account</p>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>SQL Saturday Minnesota 2024 is produced by and for the community of SQL developers, administrators, and affiliated disciplines. Event Sponsorship does not entail oversight or selection of topics or content.</p>    
    <p>While SQLSaturday Minnesota requires funds to operate, Sponsorship is also accepted as 'in-kind' contributions where the goods or services provided are those needed for SQL Saturday. We are especially interested in community groups helping plan and publicize the event. Don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions about how you can help.</p>
    <p>About 'in-kind' Sponsorships: We distinguish between Sponsors that provide 'cash', and those that supply 'in-kind' Products and Services for raffles or other use. Our reasoning is thus:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A 'cash' Sponsor provides the raw resource needed to produce SQL Saturday. In addition, it pays for equipment rental, shirts, lanyards, advertising, refreshments, and meals. Therefore, that sponsor earns significant brand recognition and exposure benefits, as outlined in the Sponsorship 'level' document (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.)</li>
      <li>An 'in-kind' sponsor provides an optional resource that we can do without if need be. Also, that optional resource often serves to provide brand recognition and exposure. At past events, some Sponsors have sponsored both at a cash level that was practical for them AND provided branded items to maximize their brand exposure. Those Sponsors then received both sets of benefits as outlined above.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Important Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Sponsorship payments must be received in full no later than <b><mark>September 1, 2023<mark></b> to guarantee inclusion in print and display materials. </p>
    <h2>The Raffle - Your Key to Success</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow-ups. Few attendees will have business cards, and having them handwrite their info often leads to a 30% or higher loss due to the inability to read what they wrote! Instead, we provide attendees with pre-printed raffle tickets containing their name and email address; they can then put these tickets into the raffle box at each sponsor's table to win a prize. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique for capturing contact information, including scanning their name badge.</p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful, all our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $100 in value and a full-color 8-1/2 x 11 flyer highlighting the prize(s) you are providing for the raffle.</p>
    <p>We will have one table for all absentee vendors in the same areas as our onsite vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day. If someone from your team is present, we'll ask them to draw the winning ticket. Otherwise, we'll select the ticket. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a physical prize, we'll give it to them. Otherwise, we'll forward their contact information for you to follow up with (for license keys, etc.)</p>
