A broadcast platform is becoming necessary after the COVID pandemic, as many events will be at least partially hybrid.

For a platform, consider the challenges of adding speakers in and out, as well as ensuring attendees have the links to virtual broadcasts.

## <a name="scale">The Scale of Your Event</a>

Many large paid conferences have avoided broadcasting, or even recording, all sessions. The cost is prohibitive, and there is a high resource cost in managing this.

For a virtual or hybrid event, we recommend shrinking the number of sessions you broadcast. You can choose to do 1 or 2 tracks/rooms only to reduce your overhead and cost. You can also consider having some speakers pre-record their sessions and making those available to attendees.

If you have pre-recorded sessions, consider adding them to the schedule and have speakers online to answer questions using a platform such as [Discord](https://discord.com/).
