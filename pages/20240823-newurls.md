As part of the migrartion, I needed to set new URLs for the various pages. My export process tried to assign things like /?p=1232 for posts with each post having its own URL. I decided that a better method would be using the number of the invite for the URL.

That meant that I would make /001 be the URL for the invitation for T-SQL Tuesday #001.

This was a manual process, for reasons I'll explain in a migration post, but the easiest thing was to just take the number and add it as the link. I ended up with 177 posts to edit, which took about 40 minutes. I spent about 15 minutes on a python script, but I had encoding issues, so I bailed.

Now you can go to tsqltuesday.com/nnn where nnn is the number of the invite to get the copy I archive of the post.
